You can make a system that addresses each creatures natural enemy, or trigger to violence.  For example trolls hate fire, and will attack the closest thing giving off flame or heat.  Orcs hate the smell of dwarf, and will attack them purely on scent.  But none of these things are making it any more of a story.  They're adding detail, but detail is just one very small part of something, and it can distract from a premise, if you even bother to have something approaching it.  <br/><br/>If your desire is to empower your friends, connect them to this thing that's going on, story is a good way to do that.  <br/><br/>Maybe this monster lost it's mother to one of the magical weapons, now in the hands of the current adventuring party?  Isn't that a juicier motivation?  You could even flashback to when the monster was just small, seeing it's mother killed.   <br/><br/>If you're just making a system to resolve questions, that has no attempt to show story, it's gonna fall flat.  <br/><br/>It's why Pandemic is a shitty rpg.  It's the opposite of story.  It removes the human drama, through distance and distillation.                     </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481416/#Comment_481416" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-28T20:15:48+00:00" title="March 28, 2019  8:15PM">March 28</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good post, Nathan.<br/><br/>I believe that, in the original discussion, I posted some examples of an algorithmic process of monster motivation, but it's hard to do.<br/><br/>It all depends on what kind of game you're playing.

This is partially on me because I didn\u2019t explicitly address your <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/481264/#Comment_481264" rel="nofollow">March 23 post</a>.</p><p>But I\u2019m glad it\u2019s in a separate thread now. Let\u2019s dig in.</p><p>It sometimes happens that only one hero is fighting a monster, or is being fought by a monster. That happened last session. The monster had a very clear diegetic reason to focus on that hero and it was obvious to everyone at the table. And so that\u2019s what happened. (It feels weird to write \u201cmonster\u201d on here since my name for them at our table is \u201cpretty\u201d, as in \u201cfly my pretties\u201d.)</p><p>We do have a human DM in order to adjudicate special situations like that.</p><p>Such special situations happen less than 1 out of 30 fights. Or less than 1 out of 100. It\u2019s happened maybe three times over these last 50 sessions.</p><ol><li>The monsters were after a book that one PC had</li><li>The monsters were after those who had entered a particular dwelling and only two PCs had</li><li>The monsters were attacked by one PC to the shock &amp; surprise of the other PCs</li></ol><p>What are the more common reasons the monster attack?</p><ul><li>Most common reason: Because they want to protect themselves or their dwelling or their master\u2019s dwelling from the murderous hobos</li><li>Second most common reason: Because they eat people and the hobos are, for the most part, people.</li></ul><p>Both of these common reasons usually lead to more than one hero qualifying for attack. Then we need a disambiguation protocol for who they attack.</p><p>Stories\u2026</p><p>It\u2019s not my job at the table to write stories. For a while we were using Microscope Chronicle to explore the previous history of magical weapons and such which would then tie back into the main game. That was awesome and, again, would lead to these rare special situations where it\u2019s clear to everyone why a monster has a particular target as their first priority. But even then it affected a very small percentage of fights.</p><p>Now, in the first two versions of my monster-target-selection protocol this wasn\u2019t explicitly addressed. Any rule can get overridden by the SIS. If so, I do it in consultation with the table.</p><p>The third (and currently most recent) version that I did last monday does have a \u201cspecial\u201d column where these kinds of special exceptions can be explicitly and openly addressed.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" rel="nofollow">Nathan_H</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>If you\u2019re just making a system to resolve questions, that has no attempt to show story, it\u2019s gonna fall flat</p></div></blockquote><p>That\u2019s what the system is. A consequence engine. It\u2019s there to resolve questions. That\u2019s why I call it \u201cthe guns on the table\u201d. We are creating story and if none of us are reaching for the guns, <em>that\u2019s fine</em>. That happens often. But when we <em>do</em> reach for them, they better be well-oiled, functional, and not dependent on me making up new facts. It is a rule in our group that the DM shall strive to not introduce new facts to the game world once it is set in motion. C.f. <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21073/four-mirror-scenarios-and-two-groups/p1" rel="nofollow">mirror story</a>.</p><p>\u201cHey, that Flame Tongue Sword you have\u2026 this skeleton\u2019s mom was killed by it!\u201d \u2190 <strong>awesome</strong> if true and will ofc influence the battle. In v1 and v2 as obvious exceptions, in v3 as a checkmark in the special column. But introducing such facts <strong>post-hoc</strong> is not part of our process. . We run \u201cfull myth\u201d.</p><p>So the reason I didn\u2019t give your original post its full due response was that the question I was asking was this:</p><p><strong>When there is a lack of clarity</strong> over who the monsters attack, who do they attack?</p><p>And your response was pretty much \u201cSometimes there is clarity\u201d.</p><p>Or, \u201cIntroduce a clarity by writing story\u201d. Which, by design, isn\u2019t part of our process. The table action is the story. All week I\u2019ve been telling people I meet in my daily life about what happened in our game last friday because it was so awesome. And that\u2019s almost every week because the game\u2026 <em>creates</em> story.</p><p>It just so happens that two of the heroes\u2019 young son was killed during the game. Not as a pre-story or pre-planned or railroaded thing. He just died in a fight. (He got tossed into a volcano by dancing fungi.) And now that\u2019s a big part of their motivation, trying to find a way to resurrect him. Monkey\u2019s paw style. \u266bI don\u2019t wanna be buried\u2026\u266b</p><p>Rather than the game being a collection of stories that I came up with, our game is a world where stories <em>happen</em> and the mechanics are there to support it being a world of physics and consequence and weight.</p><p><small>I also do write novels and comics and put on my web page. That\u2019s my outlet for my story ideas instead of taking it out on the group.

If there isn't, then protocol to resolve.<br/><br/>But one nitpick: the procedure isn't making them smarter, it's limiting them. Before the protocol the monsters were devilishly smart in a suicidal, living-bullet way. They focus-fired AF, and they weren't switching targets as often (which triggers opportunity attacks i.e. bad action econ for them). The protocol was put in place to <i>limit</i> them rather than to enhance them. That's why a large part of the protocol is limiting targets (via TOR-inspired "they primarily go for one front-rank hero each" <small>[because they'd reasonably <b>have</b> to, that's how battles are formed, lest they'd leave their backs open]</small>) and only part of the protocol is prioritizing targets (via DU-inspired "they punish backstabbers" and similar). With that in mind, the protocol isn't them being stupid either. It's more a way to add some texture to the battlefield. Since we were doing TotM we had a "anyone can target anyone" problem but with these protocols there are ranks and lines forming. Which is great, paints a way vidider picture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481422/#Comment_481422" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-29T06:38:38+00:00" title="March 29, 2019  6:38AM">March 29</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah "strategically" isn't right, more like "according to the default strategy accorded [pretties]".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481423/#Comment_481423" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-29T06:39:55+00:00" title="March 29, 2019  6:39AM">March 29</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's a perfect way to put it                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481430/#Comment_481430" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-29T13:28:37+00:00" title="March 29, 2019  1:28PM">March 29</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2019 12:13AM by Nathan_H.">edited March 30</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, the monsters that I like, that have moved me, made me "lean into" a role-playing game, or into a story, have been monsters that had obvious contradictions.  I mean, if you don't feel somewhat bad for a monster, it's not doing it's job.  Or at least, not all of it's job.  <br/><br/>I'm of the school, using your gun analogy, that if a guns on a table, people are gonna use it.  <br/>People, generally speaking, are lazy.  <br/><br/>It takes work, maybe playful work, and certainly time,  to make up a  good enough lie to explain a new development.   <br/><br/>I could make a whole post about monsters and what makes a meaningful monster and what makes a meaningless monster.  <br/>I don't think a system is gonna change a meaningless monster, into a meaningful monster.  <br/>Unless you call cause and effect a system?  <br/><br/>If a monster's just there so that players have something to do, it's being poorly used.  I would imagine you would have to ask yourself why, and that answer will most often be because I was lazy, or in a hurry.  Which is understandable.

That is, once they have their goals, they're no longer a burden to animate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481442/#Comment_481442" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-29T23:35:04+00:00" title="March 29, 2019 11:35PM">March 29</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a basic question of "what's our creative goal here?", isn't it?

When I started Dracula Dossier, at the end of one session, the 4 PCs decided to split up and go in four different directions. I had each of them get attacked because I knew I would never get this chance again. It wasn't any deeper than that, to begin with.<br/><br/>After the session, I looked at who had been attacked by whom / what, and then found reasons that it all made sense (to my surprise, I could actually do that). This worked because of the kind of sandbox that is Dracula Dossier. I don't claim it's my best gming, but it sometimes works surprisingly well. I suspect this is because the PCs and players don't spend a lot of time during the attack stopping to wonder why. I mean, afterwards? Sure, they discuss it, and then it occurs to me that a reason other than "the players gave me an opening" would be a Really Good Idea, but no one seems to mind their PC the focus of an action scene.<br/><br/>I don't run every game that way -- usually, I try to overthink and overplot on the grounds that this is how I keep up with players. And even here, the attackers didn't come out of the void or a random encounter table (not that I mind those, you understand). I had the stats on hand and a very vague idea that these existed. I just didn't think about the why or how of it all (well, not beyond "Public bathhouse? Okay, mentally ensorcelled man with a knife. In his home? Carmilla's latest "mother".")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481448/#Comment_481448" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-30T06:36:01+00:00" title="March 30, 2019  6:36AM">March 30</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" rel="nofollow">Nathan_H</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Yep.

We used to play Magic &amp; Netrunner but now it's D&amp;D all the time.<br/><br/>1. It's open source meaning we can keep on building on it &amp; improving it. Really fun &amp; also makes the game an increasingly good fit for us / me. Not that I don't have house rules for Magic. I guess I'm just a rules B.<br/>2. M I R R O R   S T O R Y<br/>I was in tears of joy, I called my mom, I felt like I finally "got it". This was what I had been searching for since I first saw an RPG back in 1992.<br/><br/>Phase 1. Did not understand the games (a Runequest clone) \u2014 to complicated &amp; no instructions on how to prep. Me, my sister and our girlfriends making characters but then never could actually start the game. My mom ran one game for us, that was fun.<br/>Phase 2. Discovered Everway, Fudge and SLUG. And Usenet. Finally got some games in! At first pretty bad since I was running for guys and they wanted me to play sexy NPCs giving them sponge baths\u2026?!?! Goodbye to those guys pretty quick. Then found some players I liked more. Made some great games, at this point I was playing super rules light or w a very stripped down Fudge. Player retention/interest wasn't great, getting a game together was a rare occasion, 2, 3 times per year maybe. The problem was it was all DM fiat, DM making things up on the fly or a preconceived idea, since we were playing in a very identifying-stance way everything they said or did was what the character said or did, leaving not much room for story idea contributions. The stories were all mine and we had some players loving them but\u2026 it was pretty much smoke &amp; mirrors.<br/>Phase 3. Trying to find good rules! Having fun with story games, kinda struggling a bit with Fate (since I was into Fudge I discovered Fate pretty much day 1 but it never clicked for us)<br/>Phase 4. Discovered D&amp;D!!! &amp; the joy of precommitted world facts.<br/><br/>Bitter over wasting two decades before "getting it" but\u2026 it's great now!<br/>Last session yesterday was another mirror-story-esque situation with lots of "physics" and weird magic items and traps to interact with and explore.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Lisa Padol" rel="nofollow">Lisa Padol</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I suspect this is because the PCs and players don't spend a lot of time during the attack stopping to wonder why.</p></div></blockquote>\nYeah, that's interesting! I have learned that everyone \u2014 <i>everyone</i> needs stats because I never know how they're gonna attack. They threw an ice storm spell at a little princess girl the other day for crying out loud!

I'll use a deviled eggs analogy.  I could just place deviled eggs, all loose-like, tossing them into the trunk of my car, and transport them to where ever I'm going with this analogy, or I can put them in a container, that's made to transport food from your house, to another house without damage. <br/><br/>Sure, you can use it, but it might be easier to use something made for what you're doing.  <br/><br/>If it doesn't matter(random), then why does it matter?  It matters because something has clicked.  You've gotten a bit of inspiration from this somewhat random, somewhat predetermined thing.<br/><br/>I don't buy into the "ends justifies the means", not that I think this is what this is exactly, but if you follow a similar train of thought, it could be.

Honestly, my brainpower is limited when running games and I'm very happy to delegate questions like this to a randomizer.  <br/><br/>Sure, if it's a goblin hit squad trying to avenge the insult the Thief character made to their Queen during the last session, then it requires more thought.  But I almost always elevate NPC's after the fact.  If the heroes kill five goblins and one of them gets away, that's the one that gets a name and becomes a recurring figure in the game.

For instance, take this procedure:<br/><br/>* Sit down together, and brainstorm a genre you'd like to play in. Try to come up with some examples of stuff that works well in this genre, until you're all on the same page.<br/>* For the player on your left and on your right, come up with an interesting relationship between your characters.<br/>* Next, think of an interesting item or location for this genre, and place it between two players.<br/>* Also come up with an interesting "need" for this genre, something that could motivate someone, and put that between two different players.<br/><br/>Or, you could pick a Fiasco playset, and roll dice, and you have everything ready.<br/><br/>Can you see why someone might prefer the latter over the former?<br/><br/>Some obvious features are:<br/><br/>* It's easier and more convenient.<br/>* It prevents creative block and helps resolve disagreements between players about genre.<br/>* It's much faster.<br/>* It may have content that's better than what your group could come up with on their own.<br/>* It will create unexpected combinations, which can break you out of a creative rut and force you to come up with something you normally would never think of...<br/>* Etc.<br/><br/>I think there's plenty of value at all points along this spectrum, personally.

It's never been that easy sounding.  Look, I'm thanked in the book, twice, but Set-up hasn't always gone smoothly, and I err on the side of story.  Sometimes it takes a couple turns 'til relationship pairings flesh out, sometimes they flip-flop.  <br/><br/>Fiasco isn't the end all be all, nor does it magically arrive at fun, for everyone, always.  Sometimes the Tilts feel wrong.  Sometimes the game doesn't reflect what happened in the story.  <br/><br/>Yes, having something to reference can be helpful, but it isn't always.  You guys act like having rules means having fun, and those two things are usually very separate.  <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481599/#Comment_481599" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-04T10:58:14+00:00" title="April  4, 2019 10:58AM">April 4</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess my RPG journey led me to that position because when I finally found rules that clicked we were having a lot more fun than the freeform scenarios we'd been doing up till then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481600/#Comment_481600" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-04T10:59:34+00:00" title="April  4, 2019 10:59AM">April 4</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Some obvious features are:<br/><br/>* It's easier and more convenient.<br/>* It prevents creative block and helps resolve disagreements between players about genre.<br/>* It's much faster.<br/>* It may have content that's better than what your group could come up with on their own.<br/>* It will create unexpected combinations, which can break you out of a creative rut and force you to come up with something you normally would never think of...<br/>* Etc.</p></div></blockquote>\nThe points you list as positives, could also be seen as negatives.  And I'm not sure that having rules helps you get there and "faster" or "better".<br/><br/>When I would play music improvisationally, it can be sometimes best to not come with anything beforehand.  Sometimes relying on a structure, previously made, without any connection to what's going on, the relationships currently between the people playing music, has just felt like a bump.  It'd usually the first thing to go, those expectations that had nothing to do with the current thing.  <br/><br/>It's just a different perspective.   I do like games, but only so much.  Rules can focus and blind.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481604/#Comment_481604" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-04T11:41:12+00:00" title="April  4, 2019 11:41AM">April 4</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you play strictly theremin / kazoo / fretless-single-stringed or do you have things like note intervals, fifth tuning, TET, piano keys etc?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481617/#Comment_481617" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-04T16:23:32+00:00" title="April  4, 2019  4:23PM">April 4</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, absolutely. There are also many downsides to rule-based constraints.

Passion should come first, then technique, and finally theory.  It's like love and bravery - love isn't shit without it.  If you don't first feel something, it's pointless.  <br/><br/>I like instruments with less going on, so that more of me can get in there.  <br/><br/>I get it, forms have preconceptions.  Guitar music sounds a lot like guitar music.<br/><br/>I do like some continuous pitch instruments, but even they have their own rules.  <br/><br/>I've been known to play a duck call, with my finger, pulling the end off, and pressing the little metal tine with my finger.

Because I did feel like you sorta jumped into my "here I'm gonna design some mechanics that fits in right with the other ones I've got"  thread and were like "duh, why don't you just create more of a story for each monster" and it'd be like I'm tryna bake a cake and you're like "OK I drive cars that's similar and here's some gasoline, add that to your dough and it'll really go".<br/><br/>Your game sounds really cool but it's so far from what I'm doing.<br/><br/>The entire rules, structure, music notes analogy was a dead end and I fucked up leaning into it. It's more like\u2026 a holodeck or a theme park or or just a big ol forest on the one hand, or a movie or a song or a novel or a play on the other.<br/><br/>I have a hard time letting the topic go because it's something that I wish I understood a long time ago and I wish I knew how to explain it. Maybe you already understand the type of gameplay I'm talking about and you've moved on from it; it's just that we're not finding the words to communicate or verify that that's the case.<br/><br/>When the mirror story happened I was like\u2026<br/>"Oh, so <b>this</b> is a roleplaying game!" That was after having been active running and playing and writing about it for 2 decades. You probably have even more experience, not trying to appeal to my own "authority" or whatever. Just trying to say that\u2026 the uh\u2026 the whatever the mirror story was / is, was something that I had not understood before it happened. Rereading other texts about roleplaying, I can see that some of them hint to the same sort of gameplay, it's just that I misunderstood them and couldn't get what they were about until I had had my own sat\u014dri kick.<br/><br/>As a player of games like Zork, Choose Your Own Adventure, Fighting Fantasy or whatever, even reading fucking Robin's Laws <small>[as much as I love Hillfolk and HHP, Robin's Laws is garbage. Sorry Robin if you're reading this but it's prob one of the worst books I've read]</small> I thought "OK, A GM presents a sequence of scenes, this happens then this happens than this happens. The more generous&amp;ambitious the GM, the more branches off that trunk there are. But instead I'll just learn to improvise."<br/>I still had a "events happen" mindset. I'd see a module with dungeons &amp; rooms and I'd still be like "OK, first they come to this room, then they come to this room, then they can choose between room A and room B..."<br/>When the mirror story happened and I realized that\u2026 we were in a tangible, consistent, solid <i>world</i> that was more than the story created in the moment, that was a place we had visited for real, through our words and through the DM's words\u2026<br/><br/>Guh, I'm not tryna convince you to change your ways. Just\u2026 it's like if you were to ask about <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21992/sit-down-pretend-without-scene-action-resolution#latest" rel="nofollow">Sit-Down Pretend Without Scene/Action Resolution</a> and I'd answer "Oh, just use GURPS and do a Quick Contest using the rules on page B348". That's not what your question was about.<br/><br/>And you fundamentally did not understand what my question was about.<br/>It was about "who <b>does</b> the monster attack". On their <i>own</i>. Once I've wound up the little spring inside and let them loose. Not "who can I come up with a fake reason why they attack someone and then have them attack that person."<br/>Because the reason would be fake and cheating given the premise of the activity I'm doing. It's not fake nor cheating in a story narration yarn spinning exercise. In fact, it's super cool there. That goes back to the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21073/four-mirror-scenarios-and-two-groups/p1" rel="nofollow">four mirror scenarios and two groups</a> thing. What's bad in one is great in the other. And vice versa. And both activities are super fun. I dearly love both. There can even be mixes of them. Like, this part of the game is this kind of game, that part of the game is that kinda game. "On the ship we get to tell improvised tales of space adventure but once combat starts it's no more improvisation." Or vice versa or w/e.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481624/#Comment_481624" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-04T19:22:57+00:00" title="April  4, 2019  7:22PM">April 4</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nathan,<br/><br/>I think that trusting human judgement, intuition, and story instincts is a time-tested and entirely valid way to create any sort of art (and I have no trouble calling story games art, whether they are profound or silly and light).<br/><br/>I think that, for Sandra, that falls short because her wants are impartiality and consistency - things human intuition is really badly suited to.<br/><br/>To play Devils advocate for a moment:<br/><br/>Given that this is your position, what kind of procedural structure or constraints do you find useful?<br/><br/>Why bother with games and rulesets at all, if you don't want constraints, for instance?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481625/#Comment_481625" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-04T19:28:15+00:00" title="April  4, 2019  7:28PM">April 4</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also feel kinda bad rn, as I do whenever I've been like super categorical in writing and then hit send and then I think back on how compromised &amp; wishy-washy &amp; sloppy my practice is in actual play.

I verbalize more of these things with people I've not played pretend with, than with people I have.  I think that's probably common, but I brought it up anyway.   <br/><br/>I might address theme in a round-about sort of way, before worrying about characters.  I don't do this with any level of professionalism.  What kind of almost-story do we want to tell?  Where?  What does it feel like?  Sometimes I'll just ask what game they want to play, but I don't stop asking questions after that.  I mean, at some point I stop asking questions, but not yet.<br/><br/>Well, I do like characters that contrast one another.  Ones with opposing lives and perspectives.  So, I like player characters to contrast, compliment one another.  I mean, the easiest way to show who a character is, is to contrast it by it's opposite.  I'm using the term opposite loosely here, but I assume you get the point.  <br/><br/>The dance of contrasts.  <br/><br/>I think dice are used as deciders because of their innocuousness.  I mean, who can argue with a simple oracle.   I think they're relied upon a it too much for creating mystery and surprise.  I guess what I'm saying is I don't find dice to be that constructive of a constraint.  They're a fuzzy petition to an authority.   Fuzzy might not be the right word, but they're a petition with varying, somewhat chaotic weight.  <br/><br/>There are constraints in life.  You don't need a rules to have them.  Creating an idea-thing has it's own boundaries too.<br/><br/>Well, games can be magical.  I think Hide and Go Seek is strangely perfect.  I'm not sure if you could create that sort of mood, that real-feeling-fake-fear, without rules?   But you don't use Hide and Go Seek to tell something that sort of resembles a story.  I'm sure you could, but it might not have the hallmarks of one without some editing.  <br/><br/>I think human intuition might be better at consistency than you're maybe willing to give it?  People are creatures of habit.  We tend to fall into patterns.  If patterns aren't consistency, than I don't know what is?<br/><br/>I like constraints, but I tend to make enough for myself.  The idea has it's own boundaries.  There's an honesty to just following cause and effect.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481630/#Comment_481630" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-04T21:08:02+00:00" title="April  4, 2019  9:08PM">April 4</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2019 9:10PM by Nathan_H.">edited April 4</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I also feel kinda bad rn, as I do whenever I've been like super categorical in writing and then hit send and then I think back on how compromised &amp; wishy-washy &amp; sloppy my practice is in actual play.

Most of our rules and laws and structures are about enforcing consistency (without law being upheld, an authority figure would almost never punish transgressors consistently, for example - family members might get preferential treatment, better looking people might as well, and so might certain ethnic groups, etc).<br/><br/>Same goes for "will this activity be the same when a different group plays?", and others potential concerns.<br/><br/>I do think that playing with the same group of friends allows us to treat many of these structures and constraints as known - unspoken rules and traditions. <br/><br/>If you're happy playing by the unwritten rules in your head, and you have the authority to enforce those (or at least have them addressed) in your group, then you arguably don't need a ruleset at all. <br/><br/>Making procedures becomes much more important when communicating those to other humans is a priority - for instance, when you play with strangers often or want to teach someone else to GM in your style.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481633/#Comment_481633" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-04T21:22:02+00:00" title="April  4, 2019  9:22PM">April 4</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rules are agreements, somewhat.

I'm sure you could, but it might not have the hallmarks of one without some editing.</p></div></blockquote>\nRemember that time we played Hide and Seek in the city and I crawled under a gate to hide in some stranger's yard? I was more afraid that <i>they</i> would catch me than you.<br/><br/>With games of this nature, games with rules... we *live* the story.<br/><br/>This is why I speak of "buy-in" where others might speak of immersion. "If you fail that roll we'll rip up your character sheet." "I know. <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/> But I'll have to risk it.

Does anyone play a role-playing game as it's actually written, maybe other than the person or people who wrote it?  They're not like checkers or chess.  <br/><br/>When I play Fiasco, I often ignore the Aftermath, maybe because it feels unnecessary by that point?  Sometimes it's nice to have that "where are they now" montage, but oftentimes it doesn't gel with what was going on at the table.  <br/>Even after Set-up, Relationship parings might flip-flop, depending on those first couple scenes.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481660/#Comment_481660" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-05T13:06:55+00:00" title="April  5, 2019  1:06PM">April 5</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2019 1:11PM by Nathan_H.">edited April 5</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>And I've outlined some of the rules that pretend has made for me to be able to run a game that don't make the pretend all fall apart.

That's story, and you wanna get rid of it for egalitarian reasons(the McDonalds of reasons - consistency). You have drama.

Maybe I'm not getting you either. I'll try to do my best effort to try to understand you or try to express my current understanding of what your saying. The underlying <i>signifi\xe9</i> you are using the NP "story" to represent is something that I associate with "things that sound cool", "it would be awesome if", "once upon a time a kid changed the rules in a lava game and that was a cool story", "once upon a time a skeleton was killed by the Blackblade and it wanted to take vengeance on the sword's new owner". Narrative, a sort of oral literature. Myth structures, dramatic irony or drama or comedy or tragedy or\u2026<br/>things that make sense as story units.<br/><br/>What I have on offer is something different. You don't have to take the apple, you don't have to change your ways. You're not even obligated to keep hearing me out or keep up this conversation or keep reading this post. I get that.<br/>I just keep writing because I'm frustrated that I can't express what I mean in an understable way, or, if you have already understood it, that <b>I</b> in my ignorance (if that's the case) is unable to understand or see that you have.<br/><br/>What I'm trying to say is the difference between a cool story and a <b>true</b> story.<br/><br/>In the mirror story we went into a cold room. Hitting every tile with our ten-foots. Carefully checking the ceiling for spiders. We went up to a vertical plane covered in thick moldy yellow curtains. Some sorta board, or painting? We touched under it. It was glass. Maybe a mirror\u2026 but why the covering? Just dust? In this dungeon we have lost so many lives from reading cursed books and tablets. We dare not look into this mirror. But\u2026 we'll fasten it to our wagon, with the curtain still on\u2026 it can be a fantastic weapon, we thought. And then later we fought The Toad Beasts. And we yoinked off the cloth and one of the beings looked at the glass surface underneath and  p o p p e d  out of existence. For it was indeed a mirror trap. This wasn't a story we heard. This wasn't a story we told around the camp fire. This was our story \u2014 not a story we created, it was a story we lived, a deed we perfomed.<br/><br/>If this had been a DM who was willing to "create stories" at the table, this is how it might've gone. "OK, they've made their way through the portcullis, what's cool to put in here\u2026 uh\u2026 some sorta\u2026 [looks around RPG playing room] yellow curtain is cool. yeah. yellow curtain. Ok, now they said they're touching behind it. It's... curtain, window\u2026 'you feel glass you guys!!!'. OK now they seem to believe it's a magic mirror, the imagination on them smh smh. But ok that might actually be pretty cool, wonder what the effect should be\u2026 nothing too dangerous. What, they fastened it to their wagon? That's unexpected but ok. [2 hours later] They pulled off the curtain and exposed the mirror to the giant toads? It's, uh, let's say that they can kill one toad with it, that sounds about fair. I can always add more HP to the remaining toads if the rest of the fight becomes too easy. Besides, rule of cool says I should give them this one. 'One toad disappear with a pop'. OK, maybe they'll just turn it to the next one, I better add 'and then the mirror cracks!'" <big><b><i>\u2190 that would've sucked!!</i></b></big> Completely invalidating what we were doing, which was... we believed in the world. We believed in the portcullis, the curtain, the mirror, the wagon, the toads.<br/><br/>Instead, what happened was <b>awesome</b>. The room <i>had</i> curtains and a magic mirror \u2014 that's in writing, and our DM just had to refer back to it \u2014 and we <i>did</i> fasten it to our wagon. Your rock <i>did</i> beat my scissors. The floor <i>was</i> lava.<br/><br/><br/>Btw, to Paul. I believe you are trying to be like "so do you see any value in any rules" to catch Nathan saying something like "ok one time we kinda did use this one rule" so you cango "aha! so you <b>do</b> admit rules can be good" or something and that's just\u2026 Nathan please don't think I'm arguing in that way as well.

So, I'm a fan of both, in the right situation.  <br/><br/>I'm sure I've written this in the discussion, but I'll write it again, the main purpose of rules, in role-playing games is for everyone to be in somewhat agreement... hopefully.  That's a big hopefully.  I don't know where in 5th Edition D&amp;D, it tells players to put away their fucking phones, and pay attention?  I imagine it does, or at least hints at it.<br/><br/>Procedure is just someone else's way of doing things.  When I cook dinner, using a new recipe, I'll follow it as best I can, if I have all the ingredients, fairly literally.  As I get to know the recipe, the more times I make it, I change things up.   Maybe I won't have everything that the recipe calls for one night?  Do you cook the same thing every night? <br/><br/>Were did I write that breaking rules is always better?  Can you quote me please?<br/><br/>I don't think role-playing games are that great for "collaborative story creation".  I can't be the only one who thinks that they make pretty shitty stories?

They start throwing rocks a bunch of skeletons; the skeletons fight back; does Drooma, Samu, Ashinell or Ran get the first arrow, mechanically?\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" rel="nofollow">Nathan_H</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>If you're just making a system to resolve questions, that has no attempt to show story, it's gonna fall flat.</p></div></blockquote>\nBut the system I did cook up to resolve the questions have [thin as they may be] ties to the SIS. The heuristics that I put in place would give out these results: they'd see this one-armed, bearded dwarve travelling with a bunch of hin and their first instinct would be to shoot at the dwarve. These puny hin can't be that dangerous. But once Samu uses his dread ambusher training to dish out some extra damage, the skellies would want to put him down. That is, until Ran pops off some of their magic missiles, making them the skeleton's number 1 enemy; but by now the groups have closed in on each other in a m\xeal\xe9e and Ran is in the back rank and hard to reach. It's still between Samu, Drooma and Ashinell \u2014 the latter hasn't done anything yet, but there are three skeletons so they go for the three front rank PCs, not wanting to leave their backs open. Swords clash until a skeleton gets in a clean hit on Drooma, and the pain from his broken ribs causes him to pass out. Now, Samu and Ashinell could shift their guard over to protect him, but maybe they don't want to lose out on Ran's firepower so instead they continue to guard them. Ran followed by Samu are still the most attractive targets because of their high damage output, but Drooma's unconscious body presents a golden opportunity as well, leaving him still a higher priority than Ashinell; however, Ashinell is still in the front rank so a skeleton keeps fighting her and another fighting Samu. However, the last skeleton keeps stabbing at Drooma who is now at death's door.<br/><br/>The system I cooked up [and yes, Wizardry, via The One Ring, deserves most of the credit, and then Dragon Union] isn't just "roll 1d4 labeled D, S, A, R." You referred to this detail as detracting from the premise and falling flat. I don't think it falls flat at all. It's awesome.

If it is, it is wholly so.<br/>Here follows some jolly good examples of hybrid experiences.<br/><br/><b>Dogs in the Vineyard.</b> Yes, I know that the game has been deleted (and I applaud <a href="/forums/profile/lumpley">@lumpley</a> for doing so\u2665) but it's the example that came to mind. PCs can die because of fallout; fallout appears through addressing of theme.<br/><br/><b>Hillfolk</b> recommends you graft another system on to it in order to handle procedural scenes (it suggest WaRP \u2014 we ofc use D&amp;D), but it does come with its own sorta crappy playing cards &amp; beads system where NPCs and monsters can be pointlessly murdered for some excitement &amp; risk but PCs can't really die, they can only suffer dramatic consequences that make them even more cool &amp; brooding. (Until the last session.)<br/><br/><b>Fiasco</b> a PC can die during the shenanigans (such as killed by other PCs) and the intent is that it's always in a way that addresses the theme of the game. And they can live on in Flashbacks or through other means of lingering on in the story via memories or schemes, as their players become scene-setters.<br/><br/><b>Microscope</b> [explicitly isn't an adventure game, but also] has shared ownership of characters so they aren't really PCs in that way. It's fine if it's a bit fuzzy and "let's just vote via pointing fingers" (or via playing cards in the case of <b>Final Girl</b>, a game similar to Microscope).<br/><br/><b>Cthulhu Dark</b>, while it is an adventure game, is set up mechanically so that actions such as "I try to run away from the shoggoths before they eat me" or "I try to kill the cultists in a life-or-death struggle" is A. conflict-level resolution, B. player-initiated, C. clear stakes&amp;intent, D. mechanically set up so that you can roll &amp; re-roll trying to survive and if you choose to do try to that but still ultimately fail, your character's fate is in away that's in harmony with the dramatic&amp;literate theme of the game, which is to say gaining ultimate insight into the workings of cosmos&amp;chaos.<br/><br/>Notably absent from this list are <b>Apocalypse World</b>, <b>Dungeon World</b> and <b>Blades in the Dark</b>, neotrad games that have enough of an adventure game vibe that I'd want an algorithm similar to the one I have set up for D&amp;D before I'd feel comfortable running them again. But wait! There <i>is</i> already an algorithm for that family of games! Look through crosshairs, announce future badness, split them up etc etc. The algorithm has more gaps-for-subjectivity than mine, but mine also has a non-zero amount (what if there are TWO dwarven fighters in the front rank who both have the "restrained condition" and who both have cast the exact same spells (as each other) this fight).<br/>So obv I'm in good company wanting to cook up an algo for these things\u2665                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481689/#Comment_481689" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-06T08:56:38+00:00" title="April  6, 2019  8:56AM">April 6</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you : I was thinking of this latter category and you answered for much more.

On the other hand, it's strange to criticize certain games for this when, as far as I know, pretty much no RPG does this (I've only heard of your house rules and, according to your comments, Dragon Union, perhaps?), so it's a pretty universal thing to face.<br/><br/>Having said that, while I can imagine it happening in AW, I feel like a game where that's an actual issue is one where the group isn't quite on board with the playstyle AW is built for. In my experience, some combination of "make their lives interesting", "look through crosshairs", the structure of threats and soft/hard moves, and, perhaps most importantly, "be a fan of the players' characters" handles this pretty well. On top of that, you get the way the rules are basically designed to guarantee a lot of agency to the players (I mean, even your character dying can be a good thing in AW), and it's pretty hard to run into trouble.<br/><br/>In combination with all that, of course, when I play AW I'm also always drawing on basic "story game principles" of protagonism and theme and moral conflict, which means that "who gets shot in gunfight" is generally a non-question: like Nathan suggests in this thread, what the fight is *about* in the first place is far more interesting and far more front-and-center.<br/><br/>I can imagine that if someone tries to play AW without an awareness of those elements, however, they could go awry. But then I'd imagine they would go awry even more easily in just about any other game.<br/><br/>In my experience, pretty much everyone runs the game way too "soft". When I run it I don't even use the armor rules as-written, because I find them entirely too forgiving (and same goes for some of the moves in 2nd Ed). The PCs are so strong in AW that you can push them pretty hard; it seems to me the game is best when that's what you do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481746/#Comment_481746" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-08T05:57:47+00:00" title="April  8, 2019  5:57AM">April 8</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>BTW, Paul, please edit that post because you have the quotes messed up, making it so that I\u2019m saying something I never said.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I hear you on making procedures public - getting the input of your players can be the best part.

The lack of The One Ring style limits on what attack types and targets the pretties could choose really exacerbated the problem. \u201cHi you get mauled by 1000 wolves\u201d, an encounter that might be easy if we were stuck with the artificial limits that miniatures would\u2019ve imposed. I am committed to making TotM work.</p><p>I acknowledged that in a pure theme-addressing game this wouldn\u2019t be an issue. DeReel asked how \u201chybrid\u201d games that have both story <em>and</em> danger elements to them would handle it. Opposite RISS corners, Impronitfol and Skillfrotz.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/RISS official, canonical theory v 1.4.1" rel="nofollow">RISS official, canonical theory v 1.4.1</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>Impronitfol and Skillfrotz are strange bedfellows but they snuck away at the prom, leaving their boyfriends by the punchbowl. Losing in style is winning. \u201cPlaying to lose\u201d and \u201cplaying to win\u201d come together in a game of portraying your character truly, completely and to the hilt, taking the consequences both mechanical and diegetic, but taking the challenge seriously. My friend said, and I\u2019ll never forget this: \u201cI do want to win. But I want to win <em>as Joanne</em>.\u201d<br/>[\u2026]<br/>The key to getting the corners to work together is to identify their conflicts and making a choice in favor of one of the two for that particular problem area. For example, when Skillfrotz, which is all about player\u2019s choices in challenges, and Impronitfol, which is all about character\u2019s choices in challenges, get together, a common conflict is when a player makes a choice for the sake of being true to their character, but the choice endangers the rest of the characters, whose players would rather make choices to try to succeed that particular mission. Adressing the issue with a choice in favor of one or the other corner, through rules (\u201cYou should do your best to succeed. This is a challenge based game.\u201d) or conveyance (\u201cWhen you stay true to your character and that puts the character in risk, you get an Inspiration token\u201d) is key to making the corners work together.</p></div></blockquote><p>I brought up some examples of hybrid games that I think do it well because they have mechanisms in place to ensure that theme trumps danger (ditv, hf, cd) or danger is less consequential (fiasco, microscope, final girl) [less consequential on the social layer \u2013 it\u2019s plenty consequential intradiegetically].</p><p>In AW, DW and BitD it\u2019s less clear cut. But they do have algorithms in place that <em>attempt</em> to address this and that\u2019s admirable; it\u2019s to the extent that <a href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">@skinnyghost</a> (according to his post-game commentary) imported the move system into SWN for that episode. Where I\u2019m trying to solve the problem via mashing up TOR and DU, he reached for AW. Making soft moves (announcing badness) before letting AW-style windows (such as flubs on the PC\u2019s behalf) lead to more harmful moves such as direct attack rolls. From an audience perspective it came across as super incoherent. Just as my algorithm sometimes have struggled with weird bugs. My algo used to really break down vs the spell \u201cConjure animals\u201d which it now addresses directly &amp; inelegantly.</p><p>So I\u2019m walking a rhetorical tightrope here; on the one hand addressing my admiration for AW\u2019s algorithm (compared to vanilla D&amp;D/SWN or compared to 90\u2019s games) and on the other hand explaining why I want to make a more explicit &amp; gloracular algorithm for my own game.</p><p>Summary:</p><ul><li>If theme says you\u2019re gonna die, that\u2019s cool</li><li>If GM/DM whim says you\u2019re gonna die, that sucks</li><li>If gloracle says you\u2019re gonna die, that\u2019s glorious</li></ul><p>The move list and principles are part of AW\u2019s gloracle.

I think it's a good illustration of how frameworks can be freeing. I kind of wish I'd had it on hand when we had a very lengthy discussion about this about 5-6 years ago:<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18672/is-aw-suited-to-gamist-challenge-based-play" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18672/is-aw-suited-to-gamist-challenge-based-play</a><br/><br/>I didn't do a very good job of explaining my position (judging from most of the replies), but AW is also a bit of a "darling" (and was even more so at the time).<br/><br/>Still, it's more or less the same topic. <br/><br/>I think our disagreement here is basically about what AW is, fundamentally, as a game. I see it very much as a "theme-addressing game", even though it's encoded into the rules and procedures in a subtle and coy way. Trying to treat its procedures as a "gloracle", in my opinion, is not ideal (though they can work in limited situations).<br/><br/>Consider, for instance, what good it does to know "who the monsters attack?" when, first of all, they are no monsters ("name everyone, make everyone human"), and, second, there are no turns (so, even if you the rules get to tell you WHO the enemy attacks, you still have to decide <i>how many times</i>!)<br/><br/>So, in my opinion, focusing on theme is what actually makes the game work (and SING!), since the procedures by themselves do not produce the magic you like to describe as the gloracle (what a lovely term!). As Deliverator describes in that thread, there are all kinds of subtle ways that the moves push play towards that dynamic, as well.<br/><br/>I'll try to take a look at Swan Song, but if it's longer than 10 mins or so I won't have time. <br/><br/><img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> It might be simply out of my reach, logistically.<br/><br/>You referred to another video where Adam talks about adapting AW moves to the game... how might I search for that one?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481755/#Comment_481755" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-08T21:20:13+00:00" title="April  8, 2019  9:20PM">April 8</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2019 9:38PM by 2097.">edited April 8</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Quickly: I\u2019d encourage you to write some about those experiences adjusting to the ruleset and how it changes your gameplay in your thread about \u201cwho do the pretties attack?\u201d - it\u2019s really interesting reading. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></p></div></blockquote><p>I think this thread is fine for the ifs and whys.

Ben\u2019s text) but I want to go a <strong>lot</strong> further (again, c.f. Ben\u2019s text).</p><p>GURPS doesn\u2019t have anything like \u201cMake soft moves unless you\u2019re in this or that situation, then you may make hard moves\u201d. So AW is more \u201cadvanced\u201d than GURPS in this regard <em>simply by having procedures for the MC to follow</em>. And AW in turn doesn\u2019t have anything that can produce crisp/discrete results like \u201cone of the skeletons will attack Drooma with a sword. Then the wight will attack Samu with a life drain ability. The three remaining skeletons will shoot at Samu with shotbows.\u201d So 2097e is more advanced than AW in this regard. <small>It could be an \u201cadvancement\u201d that in the end is ultimately completely misguided, a dead end, the 2019 equiv of ten thousand pages of tables a la Rolemaster Claw Law. People might switch over to apps for running fights or they\u2019ll go back to fudging &amp; illusionism or they\u2019ll stop playing challenged based games altogether. Or whatever. But I mean, 2097e is further along this particular vector \u2013 explicit rules for the DM \u2013 than what AW is.</small></p><p>Maybe that relationship\u2014GURPS &lt; AW &lt; 2097e\u2014is what\u2019s tripping you up. As that thread rightly pointed out, AW has some issues when it comes to challenged based play. (Although that certainly seems to be selling points of games like Burning Empires or Blades in the Dark). But the question could just as easily be: <strong>\u201cAre 90\u2019s-style games suited to Gamist/challenge-based play?\u201d</strong></p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" rel="nofollow">Adam_Dray</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I can\u2019t imagine how that works.

One is that I\u2019m feeling a bit like you ask questions, I answer them, then you re-ask the same question, I answer it again, then you re-ask it again. I get the feeling that you\u2019re not really reading my answers. I want to explain/teach this stuff, I do, but I also feel straw-dolled and my position misrepresented. I respect and am influenced by <a href="/forums/profile/lumpley">@lumpley</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">@John_Harper</a> and owe a lot to them.</p>\n<p>I feel like you want me to say \u201cAW is great it solves this completely\u201d and then you can go \u201cnuh-uh, it\u2019s not a good challenge-based game at all\u201d <b><i>or</i></b> you want me to say \u201cAW sux it can\u2019t do anything right\u201d and then I\u2019m in the position of having to try to out-design these masters. I started work on 2097e in 2014 and this particular subsystem [ripped off from the alchemical synergy of TOR and DU] started in the summer of 2018. AW came out in 2010. Two years before the mirror story even happened. It\u2019s unfair to AW to expect it to do what 2097e does. It has different design goals and it came out earlier.</p>\n<p>Now, if we get down into more specific claims such as \u201cSince AW is primarily about theme it doesn\u2019t matter if it can\u2019t address the issue\u201d or \u201cAW\u2019s procedures and principles and GM moves adequately addresses the issue\u201d or \u201cAW\u2019s non-Gamist CA makes it unable to address the issue\u201d or \u201cAW\u2019s non-Gamist CA makes addressing the issue unnecessary\u201d, I <i>could</i> make a second post why I disagree with those claims and why they contradict each other.</p>\n<p><i>But</i> I\u2019m not an expect in AW, and 2097e\u2019s restrictions denies the DM access to AW\u2019s tools. I can\u2019t <strong>separate them</strong> [the player characters] because I can\u2019t control their actions. I can\u2019t <strong>capture someone</strong> because I can\u2019t control the monster\u2019s actions. I can\u2019t <strong>put someone in a spot</strong> because I can\u2019t push encounters whenever it pleases me, they need to come from the gloracle. I can\u2019t <strong>trade harm for harm</strong> or <strong>inflict harm</strong>, the mechanics tell us when to inflict harm. I can\u2019t <strong>take away their stuff</strong> because I can\u2019t control the monster\u2019s actions. <strong>Make them buy</strong> is great\u2665 Use it all the time. \u201cSure, you can clear away the rubble. That\u2019s gonna take two hours. Do you?\u201d. Not super relevant to this issue. I don\u2019t have to <strong>activate their stuff\u2019s downside</strong> directly; but I set up the rules to do that for me (\u201cSure, you can pop off a firebolt but you\u2019re in the front rank so that\u2019s at disad\u201d) for me. <strong>Tell them the possible consequences and ask</strong>\u2026 uh\u2026 \u201cYou can take one step forward but if you do, you are going to get 22 damage from poison darts?\u201d Not saying not be clear about what the room looks like or what time it is etc, but <em>finding out</em> consequences is a big part of exploration play and is what made the mirror story so appealing. **Offer an opportunity, with or without a cost." While I can and do point out costly opportunities when they do exist, I can\u2019t <em>create</em> them whole cloth. Etc etc for the other moves.</p>\n<p>In short, 2097e isn\u2019t about me doing stuff (making moves). It\u2019s about the player characters and the gloracle doing stuff.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s not meant as slight on AW. AW has other tools because it is built on different premises and axioms than 2097e is.</p>\n<p>Reason number two is that I also got stressed out over being pushed into some sorta role digging through <a href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost%E2%80%99s">@skinnyghost\u2019s</a> videos, scrutinizing them etc. I\u2019m not here to criticize his games. I don\u2019t want to start shit with him or his math squad. It made me really really regret even mentioning \u201cYouTube\u201d vaguely, let alone giving an example episode and calling out a specific spacemaster.</p>\n<p>Reason number three: I also don\u2019t appreciate being given homework (dig up this or that clip, write this-or-that in this-or-that thread) when you then have the attitude of \u201cI personally don\u2019t have time for it so you have to go do it for me\u201d. That\u2019s sort of a double standard. My time is valuable too. As far as I\u2019m concerned I\u2019d rather just drop the entire YouTube subthread of the conversation. When it comes to doing write ups in other threads, I already <em>am</em> committed to making a more formal write-up of the system but it\u2019s not ready yet. I can answer questions though and I did link to the pencil sketch doc I\u2019m working from.</p>\n<p>I do appreciate the interaction overalll and I hope my annoyance isn\u2019t overstated. On a scale of 1 (\u201cannoyed\u201d) to 10 (\u201cvery annoyed\u201d) it\u2019s at about a 2.7 or so.</p>\n<p>I just really <em>don\u2019t</em> want you starting shit between me and those other RPG creators. They probably don\u2019t even know who I am since I\u2019m just toiling away on my own personal heartbreaker while they are stars of stage and screen, but going through my posting history here and on TBP, what I always end up regretting the most is criticizing other DMs and other games. I want us to build each other up, not tear each other down.</p>\n<p>Usually the DMs/creators I talk about the most are not the ones that bug me the most (what can I say to a cheater who teaches his followers to how stack the deck of many things and how to use sleight of hand to make bad rolls look like 20s) or the ones that already have a position pretty similar to mine (can\u2019t say much more than \u201ckeep up the good work\u201d). John, Vincent and Adam are more interesting for me to talk about, because they do come at this field genuinely and passionately but from a different angle than I do and they don\u2019t have the same blind spots I do, and perhaps also vice versa.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481778/#Comment_481778" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-09T17:58:09+00:00" title="April  9, 2019  5:58PM">April 9</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2019 5:59PM by Paul_T.">edited April 9</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sandra,<br/><br/>I've been trying to figure out how to respond, and I'm really not sure.

I'm so glad to see you posting again lately.<br/><br/>To be honest I got pretty lost in the last couple of posts. I love reading y'alls threads here, they are the best I've found on the inter webs. I'm not sure I've had enough experience speaking on this subject to make myself clear in the way you folks do, but I was playing a game last night related to this topic and wanted to recount what it was like.<br/><br/>The game is called Dungeon Crawl Classics which is an old school D&amp;D clone that uses an interesting setup for character generation called the character funnel. In that game every player has around four randomly generated villagers which are 0-level with no classes. They have a mundane profession (baker, woodcutter, soldier) and some related equipment (an axe, a goat, some rope maybe). There is also some horribly lethal dungeon and an excuse for the villagers to go into that dungeon (probably some monsters have been kidnapping the villagers friends and family and taking them in there). The point, according to the game book, is that at the end of the adventure each player will probably only have one surviving character who is reasonably fit for adventuring. But honestly that's not why I play it at all, in fact I've never played past the character funnel.<br/><br/>I just love watching to see who lives and who dies, but I would never run a game like this organically without a rule set like this. It plays to the part of me who wants to be the audience as much as the director (or whatever metaphor you want to use). What comes out is part Oregon Trail and part Conan the Barbarian and that\u2019s not a thing I would be likely to produce on my own.<br/><br/>I know that\u2019s not directly related to the question posed in this thread, but I do think the question has sort of become \u201cwhy would you ever want to leave who lives and who dies up to dice?\u201d. The answer for me is sometimes I want to be a part of a story where the up and coming soldier dies from a stray arrow, while the sickly one-eyed baker finds a ring of great power and takes his first steps on the path to greatness. Now is that what the system is designed to produce? Not exactly because the soldier does have better odds than the baker (although I have found in practice those increased odds are pretty negligible). But somehow that makes the times it does happen all the more poignant for me. Sometimes the stuff that comes out is just goofy and I enjoy that too.<br/><br/>\u2028\u2028More on topic would be to point out that one of the main character stats in the game is \u201cluck\u201d, which can be used to determine who is on the wrong end of the badness when there is no obvious in fiction guide to inform the decision. For instance, if no one has declared marching order who falls into the pit trap in the middle of the hallway? Just ask for everyone\u2019s luck stats. Players can also burn off a certain amount of there character's luck stat to add to an important roll, but of course it will come back to bite that character later. What does that really say about the fiction being produced? \u201cEveryone dies eventually\u201d maybe? I have no idea if that\u2019s good or bad.\u2028<br/><br/>\u2028Anyway I think I might have more to say about this but I\u2019m going to cut myself off here. I think I\u2019m just rephrasing some things that have already been said here but less succinctly <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481790/#Comment_481790" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-10T06:19:07+00:00" title="April 10, 2019  6:19AM">April 10</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2019 6:19AM by 2097.">edited April 10</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ebear" rel="nofollow">ebear</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>First of all, not to gush, but I love <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> posts here because they often touch on things I\u2019m interested in and have a different perspective from my own.

What does that really say about the fiction being produced? \u201cEveryone dies eventually\u201d maybe? I have no idea if that\u2019s good or bad.\u2028</p></div></blockquote><p>Yes, this is exactly on topic! Great point, I hadn\u2019t thought of that.</p><p>Luck stats, which I associate with Call of Cthulu, are great in some ways. I love how they give oracular answers rather than relying on fiat.</p><p>Yesterday (yes\u2026 fifth D&amp;D session in twelve days\u2026), something happened in our group. A character was being held under water and I asked if he had gasped for air before or not. I mean, in all honesty, he probably hadn\u2019t, but who better to answer that specific question than the player, I thought. He said \u201cI don\u2019t know, let me roll for it. 50/50 high low, high I gasped. [rolls] Yes, I have air\u201d. And then soon after, another character went under. He was more hesitant, and tbh I had seen his character be more cautious, but a pause to think about it, he decided to roll for it too and he ended up going under it with empty lungs. So both used kind of an inofficial \u201cluck\u201d roll voluntarily. They were just really committed to the sim I guess. I guess their reasoning was that the question of whether you gasp for air or not isn\u2019t something you really choose, it\u2019s just up to your reaction speed or w/e. Some sorta saving throw [unsure which category] also could\u2019ve done it.

I agree it makes the pit trap totally pointless for the type of play we're talking about.<br/><br/>I think the example you used of gasping for air was much better, and more true to the way I've used it. I think the situation where this is useful is one where we are trying to establish a predicate after it has become obviously relevant. You can ask the player to establish the fact but it's already clear by choosing one answer they are hurting themselves and choosing the other feels a bit like cheating to the player and isn't satisfying. So rather than ask at all you use the luck stat in place of that decision because it's not a fun decision to make in the first place.<br/><br/>Just like any dice roll how often you use it is more or less a matter of taste. I would prefer to use it as little as possible because it's not all that satisfying to me for what we're doing.

My hope was always that taking an educated guess would be better, in general, than relying on a random die roll, so players would still want/need to interrogate the fiction and consider strategy.<br/><br/>It was my hope that wouldn't break down in the same way that "roll Luck when there's a trap there" might, since you're still hoping to avoid the roll in the first place.<br/><br/>I never got to play the game, though.

My experience, and I've read some other people experimented and came to the same conclusion, is that it's the way it works. The soldier with the light instinctively uses it to their advantage, and the others are left with trying to adapt to what is to them seemingly incoherent moves of light beam. And when you have the light, you blind everything in front of you, Only difference : seen from behind, you're a target like the others. Also, a torch held up high can negate this, but how long can one hold a torch up high is not very long (like, first minute in a room). Ask a boom operator. Still, a clever monster wins all if it takes the torchbearer down. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> target                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481858/#Comment_481858" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-11T10:50:11+00:00" title="April 11, 2019 10:50AM">April 11</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you, DeReel, that really helped me\u2665                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481865/#Comment_481865" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-11T14:52:45+00:00" title="April 11, 2019  2:52PM">April 11</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes some sense.

Some monsters wouldn\u2019t know the spells effects and couldn\u2019t act on this knowledge.</p></div></blockquote><p>OK, yeah, this is good to address since in version 2 I explicitly called out conjured animals and armor of agathys. In version 3 (I guess I just haven\u2019t figured out how to write it) this sort of stuff belongs in the Special layer (the \u201cS\u201d in \u201cSACF\u201d) which so far is way more vaguely defined. That\u2019s also where Nathan\u2019s lore specific stuff would go.</p><p>In version one, Conjure Animals and Armor of Agathys kinda broke the system in two different ways.</p><p><strong>Armor of Agathys</strong> I just let be for the longest time. I\u2019m like \u201cHey, the system is the system, if they find an effective strategy, that\u2019s what it\u2019s there for\u201d.</p><p>But it became stupid. The monsters became like the video game Lemmings. \u201cOh hi a guy covered in glowing frost that just zapped one of our friends? Let\u2019s all go throw ourselves into that same death trap\u201d.</p><p>But I just accepted it for the longest time as an artifact of how v 1 worked.</p><p><strong>Conjure Animals</strong> on the other hand was a much harder nut to crack. If the monsters have to attack the conjured animals, everyone the party is 100% safe. If the monsters can\u2019t attack the conjured animals, they act as an unstoppable damage source that persists round after round. I went as far as to ask them to not use the spell, which was a horrible situation for everyone. That\u2019s when I knew I had to fix it. Conjured Animals can\u2019t contribute to front rank and the monsters (the DM) can choose freely whether or not to attack them. (Trying for the monsters to win the fight.)</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>I\u2019ll take the bets : a halfling with a crossbow and an ogre with a towel fighting against a pack of rats, and a skeleton archer.</p></div></blockquote><p>It was meant less as a bet and more of a fun thing to do for us which would help us grok the algo a bit better.</p><p>In this case, in the volley round the hin (or hobbit) can shoot at a target of her choice and the skellie would shoot at the ogre.</p><p>Then the m\xeal\xe9e starts. The hin with her ranged weapon would probably want to stand in the back rank, but seeing as she only has one friend \u2013 the ogre \u2013 that isn\u2019t enough to guard her. Also, <em>swarm</em> keyword monsters, such as rats, can ignore front rank anyway [I need to type that into v2 and v3! That was an omission, it was in v1]. So we don\u2019t have to worry about the medial predicates, only the lateral predicates; everyone is front rank in this situation.</p><p>Normally my skeletons are <a href="https://open5e.com/monsters/monsters_a-z/s/skeletons/skeleton" rel="nofollow">equipped with both a shortsword and a shortbow</a> but let\u2019s say this skellie just has a longbow.</p><p>The swarm of rats is the bigger threat so they go for the ogre. The skeleton set her eyes (eye\u2026 sockets?) on the hin. Since the hin and the skeleton are in m\xeal\xe9e but using ranged weapons they are both fighting at a disadvantage trying to get shots in. Neither side is carrying light and there wasn\u2019t a surprise round, so the \u201cfirst strike\u201d privilege goes to the home turf. Let\u2019s say it was the rats and the skeletons little cigarette break room and the hin and the ogre just barged in there shouting \u201cgive us yer silver ya monter scum!!!\u201d. So the rats get in the first bite v the ogre and the skeleton gets in the first shot vs the hin \u2013 at a kinda low change to hit b/c they\u2019re up in each other\u2019s FACES.</p><p>Then the ogre swats some rats w/ their towel and the hin casts a Hunter\u2019s Mark spell before then dealing a bunch of damage to the skellie.</p><p>I as DM mark a little check box in the \u201cA\u201d column for the hin dealing so much damage and the rats try to scurry over to the hin. The ogre sees the opportunity and swats at them some more. The rats bite at the hin. Seeing as no-one is handling the ogre menace, the skeleton moves over to them. That would be a perfect opportunity for the hin to get in freeby but you can\u2019t do opportunity attacks with ranged weapons, baby. The skeleton is so close to the ogre too, just as with the hin, that her shots are made at a disadvantage.</p><p>So now it\u2019s rat v hin in one m\xeal\xe9e group and skellie vs ogre in another and that\u2019s probably how it would remain unless the players themselves decide to mix it up. The ogre sick of bashing skellies wants to hit the rats and scurries over to the hin/rat messup. (That\u2019s a move where encumbrance would matter \u2013 in my house rules it does for lateral, not medial, movement.) The skeleton, same deal \u2013 ranged-only can\u2019t take advantage of opportunity attacks. So now there are these two m\xeal\xe9e groups. rat+hin+ogre in one, and skeleton in the other. Obv the skeleton would also scurry over and join the big fracas which is tough news for the hin who, having her \u201cA\u201d column checked from using Hunter\u2019s Mark earlier, is the target of all the ire of both yellow rat teeth &amp; rattling bones unless the towel master ogre lures them away by moving away again.</p><p>Obv w/ monsters this week they\u2019d die in one hit so most of this example is just in case everyone\u2019s dice runs super cold.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Ha!

Mind control spells &amp; traps in 5e often specify the targets explicitly. As you saw, the rats being able to swarm could\u2019ve affected the fight and the hin and so did the skeleton only having accessed to ranged spells.</p><p>Like, if there are one hobbit and two ogres, the ogres would normally be able to guard the hobbit, but if they\u2019re up against two skeleton sword-dorks and a pack of rats, the skeletons keep the ogres busy while the rats can nom nom hobbitses. This is also when ranged come in \u2013 1H2O vs three normal skeletons (w/ both swords &amp; bow) \u2013 two skeletons go fencing with the ogre and the last skeleton stands back and shot arrow in hin. All of that is <em>after</em> the hin has revealed herself to be a threat; if that hasn\u2019t happened the monsters are happy to only hit the ogres and won\u2019t try to jump through hoops to be able to get attacks in at the back rank.</p>\n<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481907/#Comment_481907" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-12T06:43:24+00:00" title="April 12, 2019  6:43AM">April 12</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The spatial predicates, both medial (the ranks) and lateral (the m\xeal\xe9e groups) are\u2026 "texture" that enables the abilities already in the game to retain meaning in TotM space.
