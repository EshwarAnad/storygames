Something exists if it\u2019s put into play and doesn\u2019t exist if it hasn\u2019t. (\u201cPut into play\u201d can also include things like \u201cOK, before we start, I want to say that this game is about Darth Vader in a shopping mall speaking french so those three things definitely exist\u201d.)</p><p>The GM in a no-myth game can think \u201cI really want to put this blue chair into play, I\u2019m gonna do it to the first normally furnished room the players enter, I feel such a strong attachment to this particular quantum blue chair. It\u2019s gonna get in for sure. Oh blue chair my favorite\u201d The fact that the GM is really into this blue chair does not make the blue chair half myth or the ontological state of the game \u201chalf myth\u201d.</p><p>This means, logically, that the phrase \u201chalf myth\u201d can\u2019t meaningfully be defined as \u201csome specific offscreen entities are canon, some are not\u201d. <strong>Because that\u2019s already what \u201cno myth\u201d means.</strong></p><p>Instead, for a meaningful definition of \u201chalf myth\u201d, how about: \u201csome <em>categories</em> of offscreen entities are canon, some are not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi guys, I\u2019ll run everything in Duckburg fully prepped, but things over in Gooseburg is more \u2018no myth\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi guys, everything related to combat is improvised and ran \u2018no myth\u2019, I\u2019ll just throw orcs atcha according to my own whim, but I have prepped all the entities and rules regarding the big fashion show in Veluna because I know that that\u2019s the aspect of play that we\u2019re the most invested in. Clothes, designers, audience reactions\u2014all accounted for &amp; implemented. Only with a steady whimsical stream of orc with murderous intent.\u201d</p><p>What does this mean for Burning Wheel? It\u2019s more of a no-myth game innit? There is no category of entities in the game that can be consistently expected to be solid.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485032/#Comment_485032" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T10:57:04+00:00" title="June  3, 2019 10:57AM">10:57AM</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2019 11:01AM by DeReel.">edited 11:01AM</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about "which myth" then ? as in "this game is fashion-solid with some free-orcs."

I think it was Deliverator's off-hand label for a way to play which can be really fun. (You can tell me if I misread you, Deliverator!)<br/><br/>If I were to talk about roleplaying in this fashion, I would have to only label games as "No Myth" or "Half-Myth", because the hypothetical Full Myth game does not exist (unless we limit our Exploration and the available choices for the players far more than in most RPGs - "Choose Your Own Adventure" books are arguably Full Myth, for example).<br/><br/>In other words, in every game where there is ANY "offscreen content", it is "Half-Myth".<br/><br/>However, what Deliverator was talking about, I think, is a certain type of roleplaying game which has lots of "gaps" in its prep but still retains solid prep <i>for the issues that are pertinent to play</i> (relevant to our creative goals, what we're playing to find out).<br/><br/>I like Sandra's image of "bones of steel in a cloud" for this - it's a great metaphor.<br/><br/>I think that in every game, we achieve success be figuring out <i>what is salient</i>, and then developing some means to lock that in, to make player decisions meaningful. "Locking it in" could mean prior prep, principled improvisation, assigning authorship rights, or reliable procedures (like D&amp;D's random encounters and BW's Circles tests).<br/><br/>I have barely played BW, so I can't speak to that game in particular, but it seems to have the same basic set of tools as other "character-driven games with a traditional GM/player split", so I can't imagine it would be too different from, say, a lot of PbtA games or <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>.<br/><br/>Those feel entirely different in play from "No Myth" play, because there are "bones" in the "cloud" to bounce off.<br/><br/>I think you (Sandra) are confused by this idea because what is <i>salient</i> in these games is different from what is salient in your D&amp;D game. You see a failure to do blorb properly, whereas what is actually happening is people doing exactly the right prep for their desired creative goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485096/#Comment_485096" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T19:03:23+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  7:03PM">7:03PM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, "half-blorb" or "half-Klockwerk" or "half-solid" or "half-tangible" sure.

This is great. I think it gets to the bottom of the issue.<br/><br/>You are saying: "look how much better play is when you have rules and metarules for how to introduce elements! Here are my rules and metarules and they are so great!"<br/><br/>And we are all, like, "Hell yeah! Those are awesome!" [And, of course, you're presenting them in a different - and, I would argue, better - way, but they're rules and metarules that lots of people and play traditions have used before. But I'll just call them "yours" as a shorthand for now.]<br/><br/>But then you seem to go from there all the way to, "If you're doing something similar but different, you need to reconsider, or you'll have no fun at all, like I did for a long time! It was awful, I tell ya. Because operating without those rules and metarules makes the game lose all sense of tangibility and it doesn't seem 'solid' anymore."<br/><br/>And we respond, "Yes, that feeling of solidity is pretty cool. Some games accept that nothing feels solid and that's ok, as you say - hippie games - and others have those rules you mention. But those aren't the only options. There's a <i>whole other</i> category, too, of games that operate on <i>similar but different rules and metarules</i>. And, because there <i>are</i> rules and metarules in operation, just like in the style you're describing, the games do feel tangible and 'solid' and are fun in a similar way."<br/><br/>But you are sticking to, "No! It's either my rules/metarules or <i>no rules at all</i>! Those are the only two options! A game which hybridizes in any way threatens me, because what if people get it wrong? Yuck."<br/><br/>And that's totally fine to state as a personal preference, but if you're going to make it into a statement of fact, you're going to annoy people, just like any other way of making something people are enjoying sound like a categorically bad thing.<br/><br/>Otherwise, you need to show fairly specifically how and why doing a hybrid is going to lead to <i>a specific and recognizable problem</i>. If you do that, then people playing that way (which is a lot of people just now!) can go play and then notice that same problem and understand what you were saying (and change how they play and potentially join your crusade <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> ).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485127/#Comment_485127" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T21:53:44+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  9:53PM">9:53PM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Does BW in practice and at the table use [information separation, each player character is only being run by one player each, identifying stance and GM plays world] in a vanilla way?

Can be played blorby, e.g. Burning THAC0, but generally it's perfectly good practice for a GM to figure out a bunch of elements that can challenge player character beliefs and some will be blorb-like and some will be ready to introduce as a failure consequence whenever it makes sense.\n<blockquote>Games that do use them should be blorby.</blockquote>\nAnd the reason I think it works in BW is because the map includes belief-space.

I think that if you mean "blorby" is a question of how solid and committed to prep things are, they are definitely less "blorby" than your games. (For example, you'd rarely use or need random tables in AW; they wouldn't make the game better except in rare cases where the MC doesn't have ANY good ideas and neither do the players.) However, if it's a question of following principles of saliency and making things up in a principled fashion, then it's a good match.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>But what I <em>am</em> trying to do is to show how awareness of these issues, and these design tools (the three tiers of truth for example) can make design crisper, more focused, more better.

Blades and WoDu too. Burning Empires took me <i>years</i> to understand and then as soon as I understood it, I sold it.<br/><br/>AW <i>is</i> pretty clear to understand here but it could be more ontologically satisfying if it had even more clarity around these issues (regardless of where it decided to land on the issue).\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>In any case, it seems to me that many/most OSR circles have some version of that understanding.</p></div></blockquote>\nYou're right\u2014it's a codification of their unverbalized practice.
