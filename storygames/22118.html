Something exists if it\u2019s put into play and doesn\u2019t exist if it hasn\u2019t. (\u201cPut into play\u201d can also include things like \u201cOK, before we start, I want to say that this game is about Darth Vader in a shopping mall speaking french so those three things definitely exist\u201d.)</p><p>The GM in a no-myth game can think \u201cI really want to put this blue chair into play, I\u2019m gonna do it to the first normally furnished room the players enter, I feel such a strong attachment to this particular quantum blue chair. It\u2019s gonna get in for sure. Oh blue chair my favorite\u201d The fact that the GM is really into this blue chair does not make the blue chair half myth or the ontological state of the game \u201chalf myth\u201d.</p><p>This means, logically, that the phrase \u201chalf myth\u201d can\u2019t meaningfully be defined as \u201csome specific offscreen entities are canon, some are not\u201d. <strong>Because that\u2019s already what \u201cno myth\u201d means.</strong></p><p>Instead, for a meaningful definition of \u201chalf myth\u201d, how about: \u201csome <em>categories</em> of offscreen entities are canon, some are not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi guys, I\u2019ll run everything in Duckburg fully prepped, but things over in Gooseburg is more \u2018no myth\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi guys, everything related to combat is improvised and ran \u2018no myth\u2019, I\u2019ll just throw orcs atcha according to my own whim, but I have prepped all the entities and rules regarding the big fashion show in Veluna because I know that that\u2019s the aspect of play that we\u2019re the most invested in. Clothes, designers, audience reactions\u2014all accounted for &amp; implemented. Only with a steady whimsical stream of orc with murderous intent.\u201d</p><p>What does this mean for Burning Wheel? It\u2019s more of a no-myth game innit? There is no category of entities in the game that can be consistently expected to be solid.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485032/#Comment_485032" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T10:57:04+00:00" title="June  3, 2019 10:57AM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2019 11:01AM by DeReel.">edited June 3</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about "which myth" then ? as in "this game is fashion-solid with some free-orcs."

I think it was Deliverator's off-hand label for a way to play which can be really fun. (You can tell me if I misread you, Deliverator!)<br/><br/>If I were to talk about roleplaying in this fashion, I would have to only label games as "No Myth" or "Half-Myth", because the hypothetical Full Myth game does not exist (unless we limit our Exploration and the available choices for the players far more than in most RPGs - "Choose Your Own Adventure" books are arguably Full Myth, for example).<br/><br/>In other words, in every game where there is ANY "offscreen content", it is "Half-Myth".<br/><br/>However, what Deliverator was talking about, I think, is a certain type of roleplaying game which has lots of "gaps" in its prep but still retains solid prep <i>for the issues that are pertinent to play</i> (relevant to our creative goals, what we're playing to find out).<br/><br/>I like Sandra's image of "bones of steel in a cloud" for this - it's a great metaphor.<br/><br/>I think that in every game, we achieve success be figuring out <i>what is salient</i>, and then developing some means to lock that in, to make player decisions meaningful. "Locking it in" could mean prior prep, principled improvisation, assigning authorship rights, or reliable procedures (like D&amp;D's random encounters and BW's Circles tests).<br/><br/>I have barely played BW, so I can't speak to that game in particular, but it seems to have the same basic set of tools as other "character-driven games with a traditional GM/player split", so I can't imagine it would be too different from, say, a lot of PbtA games or <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>.<br/><br/>Those feel entirely different in play from "No Myth" play, because there are "bones" in the "cloud" to bounce off.<br/><br/>I think you (Sandra) are confused by this idea because what is <i>salient</i> in these games is different from what is salient in your D&amp;D game. You see a failure to do blorb properly, whereas what is actually happening is people doing exactly the right prep for their desired creative goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485096/#Comment_485096" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T19:03:23+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  7:03PM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, "half-blorb" or "half-Klockwerk" or "half-solid" or "half-tangible" sure.

This is great. I think it gets to the bottom of the issue.<br/><br/>You are saying: "look how much better play is when you have rules and metarules for how to introduce elements! Here are my rules and metarules and they are so great!"<br/><br/>And we are all, like, "Hell yeah! Those are awesome!" [And, of course, you're presenting them in a different - and, I would argue, better - way, but they're rules and metarules that lots of people and play traditions have used before. But I'll just call them "yours" as a shorthand for now.]<br/><br/>But then you seem to go from there all the way to, "If you're doing something similar but different, you need to reconsider, or you'll have no fun at all, like I did for a long time! It was awful, I tell ya. Because operating without those rules and metarules makes the game lose all sense of tangibility and it doesn't seem 'solid' anymore."<br/><br/>And we respond, "Yes, that feeling of solidity is pretty cool. Some games accept that nothing feels solid and that's ok, as you say - hippie games - and others have those rules you mention. But those aren't the only options. There's a <i>whole other</i> category, too, of games that operate on <i>similar but different rules and metarules</i>. And, because there <i>are</i> rules and metarules in operation, just like in the style you're describing, the games do feel tangible and 'solid' and are fun in a similar way."<br/><br/>But you are sticking to, "No! It's either my rules/metarules or <i>no rules at all</i>! Those are the only two options! A game which hybridizes in any way threatens me, because what if people get it wrong? Yuck."<br/><br/>And that's totally fine to state as a personal preference, but if you're going to make it into a statement of fact, you're going to annoy people, just like any other way of making something people are enjoying sound like a categorically bad thing.<br/><br/>Otherwise, you need to show fairly specifically how and why doing a hybrid is going to lead to <i>a specific and recognizable problem</i>. If you do that, then people playing that way (which is a lot of people just now!) can go play and then notice that same problem and understand what you were saying (and change how they play and potentially join your crusade <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> ).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485127/#Comment_485127" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T21:53:44+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  9:53PM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Does BW in practice and at the table use [information separation, each player character is only being run by one player each, identifying stance and GM plays world] in a vanilla way?

Can be played blorby, e.g. Burning THAC0, but generally it's perfectly good practice for a GM to figure out a bunch of elements that can challenge player character beliefs and some will be blorb-like and some will be ready to introduce as a failure consequence whenever it makes sense.\n<blockquote>Games that do use them should be blorby.</blockquote>\nAnd the reason I think it works in BW is because the map includes belief-space.

I like it a lot.</p></div></blockquote>\nOh, jeez, and you know what... <i>not</i> knowing that is a good way to ruin the game. I had a friend who was like, "I like the Fight! mechanics. Our game should have more fights." And I replied, "Well, write more fighty Beliefs then." And she was like, "But that's not what my character would dooooooo..." <b>*maximum facepalm*</b><br/><br/>I think the GM and I could have done a better job, perhaps, of making it as explicit as the text does that Beliefs are about player priorities. But mostly I do lay this failure at the feet of the player, because she just wasn't able to listen to that at that time.<br/><br/>Anyhoo, in terms of the three tiers, here is how BW works:<br/><br/>1) Prepped stuff: prep things that are either directly related to challenging the PCs' Beliefs, or to the GM's Big Thing, but not much else. Drawing a reasonably-detailed map of an area the PCs are traveling through is fine. (I have done this and it was helpful.)<br/><br/>Anything you prep like that, you definitely need to stick to.<br/><br/>2) Gloracle: What Gloracle there is, is entirely player-facing, actually. Guy is a bit too dismissive, in my opinion, of just how hippy-<i>ish</i> (w/o being fully hippy, obviously) BW really is. (Not only is there entirely transparent, player-facing methods for authoring <i>some</i> setting facts, but you also have explicit GM-stakes setting, and even stakes negotiation in many cases. Stakes-setting is somewhat un-blorb, right?)<br/><br/>(You can also use system-neutral gloracle stuff like name lists for, you know, a random Dwarf the PCs meet. XGtE strikes again!)<br/><br/>3) Stuff the GM makes up on the spot using the principle of saliency: yes, there is a fair amount of this. But there are very solid meta-rules in play around how this aspect works:<br/><br/>-Don't introduce anything contradictory to what came before, in terms of facts<br/>-What you introduce should fit with the tone and genre boundaries established in Session Zero and up til now<br/>-As much as possible, what you introduce should pose awkward choices for one or more PCs and their Beliefs. I want to expound on this one, because it's not as hard as it sounds. What you're really doing is having the PCs already in the middle of doing something to pursue one of the Beliefs, and then they fail a roll or something. So usually it will be fairly obvious what would be a reasonable consequence that makes pursuing that Belief harder. And remember, if the GM can't think of any interesting consequences, then there <i>can't</i>, by the rules, be a roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485148/#Comment_485148" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-04T02:16:07+00:00" title="June  4, 2019  2:16AM">2:16AM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could someone explain to me what the hell \u201cblorb\u201d means so I don\u2019t have to try and figure it out?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485150/#Comment_485150" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-04T02:36:41+00:00" title="June  4, 2019  2:36AM">2:36AM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, Jeff... did you just wander into this, sight-unseen? <img alt=":pensive:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/pensive.png" title=":pensive:"/> <br/><br/>It's a Sandra-word; here's a useful link -<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/22097/etymology-of-blorb" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/22097/etymology-of-blorb</a><br/><br/><br/>Matt/Deliverator,<br/><br/>That's a pretty good summary!

Not all of them\u2014it has pretty traditional-ish crunchy rules for simulating the medieval / fantasy world, casting spells, injuries, weapons, and so on. But it has some really huge\u2014and ongoing\u2014non-trad techniques at play as well. <br/><br/>Not only does it have Circles, Wises, and other knowledge skills. <br/><br/>Not only does it have the players constantly telling the GM how to prep by evolving their Beliefs.<br/><br/>It also <i>doesn't break</i> if you start, for example, breaking character monogamy. Sometimes you do, in fact, play someone else's relationship character if your character isn't around but you don't want to sit out. This isn't 100% supported by the rules-text, but it's not... like, a huge problem if you do this sometimes.<br/><br/>I'd also argue that it has <i>radical</i> transparency of method relative to most traditional games.<br/><br/>BUT! You're <i>right</i> that much of the appeal of BW is in those very hard-coded rules: the detailed tactical combat, the strategy of how character advancement works, and so on. OTOH, lighter games that use the BW engine do exist and are great.\n<blockquote>You're right that it asks you to "switch stances" sometimes, in limited and circumscribed areas. So do PbtA games.<br/><br/>Some people are bothered by this. Some people aren't bothered by it at all - they love it! Still others are a bit bothered, but they accept it because they like the effects on play, and that's a worthwhile tradeoff for them.</blockquote>\nYeah, I think the "are you bothered by needing to change stance?" question may be at the root of a lot of the disagreements / misunderstandings in this thread. BW is probably not a good game to be a PC in if you can't comfortable switch stances! Note, though, that this is much more of a "veteran gamer" problem than a "new player" problem.

It's certainly got lots of interesting technology in it! And those bits and pieces have a major impact on gameplay.<br/><br/>However, I also think that it's closer to a traditional game than a "hippie game", because Sandra has been talking about "hippie games" as ones that don't have a GM or traditional resolution mechanics (e.g. Fiasco). BW seems more like something like Sorcerer or The Shadow of Yesterday to me, on the spectrum of traditional-hippie: it's got some stuff in it, yeah, but it's still fundamentally "you are the GM and I play my character who has stats and abilities and stuff, and we roll to see how well I do". <br/><br/>Your comments about character non-monogamy surprised me. Is there anything about BW that makes it more or less amenable to character non-monogamy than in other "GM + players" RPG? Nothing comes to mind for me, but I don't know all the ins and outs of the game all that well (especially compared to someone with in-depth knowledge, like yourself).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485158/#Comment_485158" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-04T02:54:06+00:00" title="June  4, 2019  2:54AM">2:54AM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BW is definitely a "relationship sandbox," at least normally. So sometimes it's helpful to have NPCs in the relationship-map personified, and sometimes more than one at a time in the same scene.<br/><br/>BW also has the benefit of it being very easy to determine NPCs' stats on the fly and in a world-consistent way. In some respects, this may be one of its blorbiest aspects. But it means that if you're playing a character who isn't your PC, and you need to make a roll, it's really easy to figure out the dice pool, generally speaking.<br/><br/>BTW, Luke might be horrified at me and my friends playing around with character non-monogamy like that! In Burning Empires you can definitely play your character's second-in-command in scenes, that's RAW; we're just taking that principle a little further.<br/><br/>As for the broader question of where BW falls on the spectrum of hippie ---- traditional, well, let me add this:<br/><br/>It is in fact possible to play BW without a GM. Jonathan White and I created a hack of it called Burning Kingdoms, layering the Burning Empires faction / disposition rules onto the usual fantasy BW. Each player controls an entire faction in the gameworld: a leader, their 2iC, military units, etc.<br/><br/>I've played in two almost-complete campaigns of it. One had four factions, the other had three. Both fell apart for (very different!) social reasons, but the gameplay was fabulous. Some of the most fun I've had roleplaying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485160/#Comment_485160" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-04T03:05:46+00:00" title="June  4, 2019  3:05AM">3:05AM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Guy is a bit too dismissive, in my opinion, of just how hippy-ish (w/o being fully hippy, obviously) BW really is.

That means no preplanned-events, railroading, nudging of players, fudging of random results, or hard-framing (skipping over potential decision points to reach a more dramatic moment).  If the GM can move the gears arbitrarily, it's not Klockwerk.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485191/#Comment_485191" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-04T13:27:23+00:00" title="June  4, 2019  1:27PM">1:27PM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Getting more &amp; more onboard with this new 'Klockwerk' metaphor                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485204/#Comment_485204" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-04T13:53:16+00:00" title="June  4, 2019  1:53PM">1:53PM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            moconnor &amp; Guy Srinivasan,<br/>Thanks for the explanations <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485211/#Comment_485211" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-04T14:28:38+00:00" title="June  4, 2019  2:28PM">2:28PM</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2019 2:55PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited 2:55PM</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>You know my philosophy right?</p><p>Games that don\u2019t use the four traditional techniques in a vanilla way (that\u2019s information separation, each player character is only being run by one player each, identifying stance and GM plays world) can be as unblorb as they like.</p><p>Games that do use them should be blorby.</p></div></blockquote>\nSandra, I\u2019m trying to follow your train of thought here, to see if I can get to what is the essential issue for you. So by \u201cblorb\u201d you essentially mean: rules and prep which determine what happens in story in a way that is transparent and that are impartial and don\u2019t lend themselves to being able to being changed upon the GMs whim. There are procedures, and there has been planning, so that things don\u2019t just happen willy-nilly or by GM fiat, so they stay tangible, impartial, transparent, etc. <br/><br/>So does this basically come down to the relationship between the GM and the PCs and creating a solid space in which the fiction is based on impartial and non-subjective  systems. So that the player\u2019s feel that their choices matter; that there is a there, there; and that they haven\u2019t been treated unfairly or arbitrarily by the GM?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485218/#Comment_485218" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-04T14:52:40+00:00" title="June  4, 2019  2:52PM">2:52PM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, good summary; and I'm not really sure how big the overlap between "there's a 'there' there" and the fairness issue, it's a non-zero overlap, sure, but there's also something to these two issues when looked separately\u2665                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485222/#Comment_485222" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-04T15:11:44+00:00" title="June  4, 2019  3:11PM">3:11PM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Right, good summary; and I'm not really sure how big the overlap between "there's a 'there' there" and the fairness issue, it's a non-zero overlap, sure, but there's also something to these two issues when looked separately\u2665</p></div></blockquote>\nOk, I think we should talk about the essence of your argument, because I think people are getting sidelined in semantics. So, I\u2019m going to try to frame your argument, and the reason you feel the way you do. I would say your argument is something like the following:<br/><br/>Players who are playing to identify with their <br/>characters are treating the world their characters experience and are interacting with as solid and real and reliable; they want their character\u2019s to interact with that world and that world to react in an impartial manner and not feel cheated by the GM or feel like their experience of its tangibly is illusionary. Players are identified with these characters in these types of games, that is why they play games which have these features, and if their interactions don\u2019t feel solid, non-arbitrary, and fair it takes them out of that identity-stance and it becomes about whether or not the GM was fair or made the right choice. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485223/#Comment_485223" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-04T15:14:08+00:00" title="June  4, 2019  3:14PM">3:14PM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, and not to get into another semantics nitpick, but the "feel" part in the way you wrote it ("feel solid") can open players up to get illusionismed and that's not really what I want;

Both in terms of rules application, and when it comes to making aesthetic judgments about what would be interesting to add to the already-prepped stuff.<br/><br/>Now, I'm trying to think about what it would be like to play in a game where there's solid blorby prep but the GM wasn't very fair. Y'know, I actually think about a month or two ago I had just such an experience.<br/><br/>There weren't really random encounters, but the GM clearly had a good sense of which monsters were where, and there was even some amount of reactivity to that setup. However, he didn't know the rules <i>at all</i> (this was nominally AD&amp;D1E, and the guy didn't even know how THAC0 worked), and thus was very inconsistent in adjudicating action resolution, making sure that character abilities worked consistently, and so on. In short, there was the spine of a good adventure there: it was pretty basic, but there was nothing wrong with his prep. But he had that "GM is god, rules don't matter" attitude, and thus the game sucked. I actually rage-quit after a particularly bad moment of non-transparency and arbitrariness in application of system. (I <i>should</i> have rage-quit at a much earlier moment, when he had us roll saving throws to not piss our pants, which was much more obviously humiliating and rage-quitting would have been more justified.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22118/half-myth-why-burning-wheel-is-a-no-myth-game" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22118/half-myth-why-burning-wheel-is-a-no-myth-game" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22118/half-myth-why-burning-wheel-is-a-no-myth-game/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F22118%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F22118%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
