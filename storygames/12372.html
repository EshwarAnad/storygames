I was asked to run it in that context recently.<br/><br/>In that kind of situation, I think Dogs could benefit from a quick, easy character creation. Something that:<br/><br/>a) Gets people over the "do I need a character background/history for this game?" question.<br/>b) Helps people come up with their Traits quickly and easily, while<br/>c) getting them into the mood of the game.<br/><br/>I've seen too many people (including myself, the first time I made a Dogs character) struggle too much for an "interesting" character concept and then come up with Traits that never came into play.<br/><br/>So, here's what I've come up with, in two parts:                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277473/#Comment_277473" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-23T08:57:24+00:00" title="June 23, 2010  8:57AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2010 9:42AM by Paul_T.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Step One</b><br/><br/>Here, you decide on your Dog's Background, and then allocate your Stat dice.<br/><br/>[Note: All the random creation stuff is intended to get you playing faster. If you have your own ideas ready, you can always just choose options instead of rolling. The idea behind rolling is to get ready faster when you don't know what to do--such as if you're playing Dogs for the first time.]<br/><br/><b>Background</b><br/><br/>Draw a single card from a deck of playing cards and note the suit or roll a d4:<br/><br/>* (1) Hearts<br/><br/>Strong Community: You come from a supportive community, with many loved ones, family, and many friends. Their support has allowed you to become a Dog. You know what a good, strong family--and a good, strong Town--looks like.<br/> <br/>* (2) Spades<br/><br/>Complicated Community: You've come from a tough place, a tangled life, an family falling apart. You hope being a Dog will help you overcome that and build a better life for yourself and those around you.<br/><br/>* (3) Diamonds<br/><br/>Strong History: You've got what it takes. Your Steward was a strong man; you probably know your Faith well. You were <i>the</i> obvious choice for your Town to send to Bridal Falls.<br/><br/>* (4) Clubs<br/><br/>Complicated History: You've seen some bad things in life. Things most of the Faithful wouldn't know how to handle--but you just might. Maybe you're just more worldly than the average Dog, or maybe you struggle to do the King of Life's will yourself.<br/><br/><br/><i>Note: I've left out the "Well-Rounded" background.

Write a short sentence giving a detail about your background. This will become a Trait in step two.<br/>2.

So if you don't know, just leave those dice unassigned until you can figure it out in play, or ask the GM for a list of NPCs in the Town you're heading to, and pick a few of them as your Relationships.<br/><br/>Traits and Belongings, though, those we can do:<br/><br/><b>1. Traits</b><br/><br/>You will need to generate at least two or three Traits for your character. For each one, you will roll up a <i>theme</i> and a <i>statement</i>, then write your Trait. Stop when you feel like you know your character a little--in any case, you can't have more Traits than the total number of Trait dice you start with. Three of four Traits is perfect.<br/><br/>* <i>Table 1: Themes</i><br/><br/>Roll a d20.<br/><br/>1. Family<br/>2. Faith<br/>3. Justice served<br/>4. Money<br/>5. Children<br/>6. A woman's role<br/>7. A man's role<br/>8. Sin (choose: sex, prostitution, murder, taking what's not yours by right, something else)<br/>9. Love, Sex, &amp; Marriage<br/>10. Duty<br/>11. The authority of elders<br/>12. Outsiders (choose: Mountain Folk, non-Faithful)<br/>13. Fitness/athleticism<br/>14. Superstition/witchcraft/the supernatural<br/>15. Parenthood/parents<br/>16. The doctrine of the Book of Life<br/>17. Blood, violence.<br/>18-20. Guns<br/><br/>In addition to these, every character also has the theme "the Lord's Watchdogs". Roll a statement for that, below. The result becomes either a Trait or a Relationship, as you wish.<br/><br/>* <i>Table 2: Statements</i><br/><br/>Roll a d8.<br/><br/>1. I excel here<br/>2. This is my weakness/flaw<br/>3. I fear this/I fear for this<br/>4. I would protect this with my life... or another's<br/>5. My knowledge/experience with this runs deep<br/>6. I am scarred by this.<br/>7. Someone took this from me.<br/>8. I have earned this with my sweat and blood.<br/><br/>Once you have a theme and a statement, write a short phrase about this thing in the first person. Think of it as a little tidbit of your character's personal history that you're discovering. That phrase becomes your Trait. <br/><br/>Once you feel you have enough Traits, assign your dice to them.<br/><br/>Examples: <br/><br/>You roll "Guns" and "I excel here". You write: "I'm a good shot."<br/><br/>You roll "The doctrine of the Book of Life" and "I am scarred by this". You write: "I fear my soul is already condemned." Or maybe: "I have strayed from the King of Life's will."<br/><br/><b>2. Belongings</b><br/><br/>You have:<br/><br/>* Your Dog's Coat, symbol of your authority<br/>* A horse<br/>* A jar of consecrated earth<br/>* The Book of Life<br/>* A gun<br/><br/>If you like, add one other possession you carry to the list.<br/><br/>Now assign dice:<br/><br/>* Pick one item: it is <i>Excellent</i>, high quality, expensive. Write "1d8" beside it.<br/>* Pick one item: it is <i>Big</i>, impressive, powerful. Write "2d6" beside it.<br/>* Pick one item: it is <i>Crap</i>, poor, shoddy, worn, old. Write "1d4" beside it.<br/><br/>The others, write "1d6" beside them. <br/><br/>Finally, write "+1d4" beside any item that is a gun.<br/><br/><b>Finishing Step Two</b><br/><br/>If you didn't assign your Stat dice in Step One, do so now: you'll know where they go by now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277483/#Comment_277483" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-23T09:38:59+00:00" title="June 23, 2010  9:38AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2010 9:49AM by Paul_T.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thing is just a "Little Idea" I had on the subway yesterday.

I would love to have your help here. Some of the Themes are not so hot--help me out! I'll edit them above as better alternatives come up.<br/><br/>In general, the idea is to create characters quickly but also get everyone into the spirit of the game quickly--it should help cut down on some of the "pre-game spiehl" you need to make as a GM when running Dogs for new players.<br/><br/>The rules for determining Belongings are intended to introduce people to how the Belongings rules work as well as help define each Dog. Take them as an opportunity to explain how the Coats are made in this "Wild West that never was": maybe lead by asking the player with the Strong Community background, "Is your Coat Excellent?" Or the one with the Complicated Community background: "Is your Coat crappy? Why not?"<br/><br/>What do you think?

They say, "Huh? Help." (This one is fairly rare.)<br/>b) A person is afraid to play without a character concept that's "cool enough" or "powerful enough" or what-have-you. The kind of person who sits there trying to think of a character concept and background before committing to play. I wish someone had told me not to have too much of a character concept before playing the first time I played! Dogs is different from a lot of games in this respect. Along the same lines, I've seen many gamers with the habit of writing really long lists of equipment/possessions--especially if they worry about the GM playing "against them" and want to have all this stuff written down on their sheet *before* we start.<br/>c) Perhaps most importantly: I think/hope that it communicates a lot about the Dogs world, saving the group some time in terms of "learning about the Dogsverse". By choosing a background, you've learned a little more about how becoming a Dog works, for example. Seeing the list of themes gives you some idea that you don't need or want to create a bunch of Traits about your character's "Gun Maintenance", "Fishing", "Keen Sense of Taste", and similar Traits, which can add a lot to certain types of games but not to Dogs. I think I saw a Dog with a 3d8 Trait in "Mountain Climbing", for example. As you can imagine, it never saw play.<br/><br/>So, I'm really thinking of beginners and one-shots without much time to explain things, and that kind of situation. I think it would have helped me in my first game.<br/><br/>What you're talking about, though, is another use: for people who've played Dogs a LOT, it might inspire them with some different Dogs concepts. (I feel like I always end up playing the same Dog over and over, for example.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277506/#Comment_277506" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-23T10:31:19+00:00" title="June 23, 2010 10:31AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2010 10:31AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think your only valid point is C, the other two being easily solved by communicating expectations and being helpful.

I've seen people struggle with my a) and b), but maybe they just didn't have people on hand to tell them what to do differently. Still, not everyone has that kind of personal resource on hand, so tools are handy.<br/><br/>As for the Mountain Climbing, I'm thinking specifically of a situation like this: The GM is running a game at a con (or something similar), shows up with a prepared Town, explains what the game is, quickly runs players through character creation and initiations--there's only a few hours left to go. Several characters have Traits like "Mountain Climbing"; everyone's trying to figure out how this game works, we need to wrap up the game by the end of the slot. Most GMs I know would "totally fail" in that situation, including myself. Do you disagree with that?  The effort required to run the Town and keep the drama going tends to override any attempt to look over character Traits and work them in, in my experience, especially in a Town that's running tight on time (whether in real life time or in-game time). Like, "your brother's walking across town to shoot the shopkeeper's wife. What do you do?"

So whether you've got a trait like "I used to spend my days in the Mountain wilderness" or "Mountain Climbing", you have figure out what that Trait's description implies that you know, or can do.  Doing so requires some creativity, and sometimes negotiation during play to justify a use of the Trait.<br/><br/>Continuing the "Mountain Climbing" example, the obvious extrapolation is that the Dog would be able to hold on to things well with his or her hands, would have good endurance, be able to tie strong knots, judge the soundness of stone structures, and such; but since religion is so prevalent in the Dog's life, it's reasonable to expect that the Dog would know parables and proverbs related to mountains that could give leverage during talking conflicts.  It's also reasonable to suggest that the Dog has spent a lot of his climbing time in solitude; allowing him ample prayer and meditation time, giving him an edge in conflicts. <br/><br/>"Mountain Climbing" might not be as fancy or imaginative a Trait as "I used to spend my days in the Mountain wilderness"; but there's no reason why that should gimp its versatility.<br/><br/>To address "your brother's walking across town to shoot the shopkeeper's wife. What do you do?" specifically, the first thing to do is to initiate a conflict with the stakes "do I get to the Shopkeeper's house before my brother?" and roll dice, then as a raise you can have your dog say "with my climbing expertise, I scale the building wall in order to take a more direct route to the shopkeeper's via the building roofs" and roll in the "mountain climbing" dice, or something like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277600/#Comment_277600" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-23T17:49:40+00:00" title="June 23, 2010  5:49PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good points, Leo and Jason.<br/><br/>Does that make this character creation process useless/unnecessary?

In every Dogs game I've ever played or run (even with Vincent), the creation process has been a lot of stare, study, scribble, study, study, scribble, etc. And that's <i>besides</i> some players having uncertainty or inexperience issues. I am all about a tool that can cut that down.<br/><br/>One tool I want to use that I always forget to is to talk about what everyone's Dogs are like before designing the stats. This means not even handing out the character sheets until we've informally talked and gotten a nice brief but clear picture of each Dog. In such a sitch the character sheet would hopefully write itself. But I've never been present enough to try it.<br/><br/>I really like what you're doing, Paul, for several reasons. One, I like random generation and the creative boost it gives you if you're willing to let it. Two, as you say it conveys what sort of things are good and fitting for this game. That's a super-great teaching tool, which as you say could eliminate a lot of the need for explainy-talk that takes you away from actually <i>playing</i>. And Three, like all good random roll charts it also functions as a pick list for those who don't want to roll, so people can get the benefit of self-determination AND the benefit of outside prompting.

I can see value in this for people who have difficulty deciding on character concepts, or people who just prefer to let the dice do the work of building the character.  I also definitely see value in this as a teaching tool for players new to Dogs, and story games in general, within whom the expectation that character traits/stats must be, or are names like "Climbing", "Horse Riding", and so on, is deeply entrenched.<br/><br/>I encountered that very situation with one of my players when I first decided to run Dogs for them.  We were all long time players, but this particular player had no exposure to story games whatsoever.  His mindset was very firmly set in the traditional game mode and he struggled to break out of that box.  This random character generation tool would have been very valuable to help him out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277655/#Comment_277655" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-24T08:17:19+00:00" title="June 24, 2010  8:17AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great, I'm glad to hear that.
