If one player has been consistently shot down.<br/><br/>The drama is lopsided &amp; the token economy is lopsided to match that.<br/><br/>What\u2019s dumb about Hillfolk as written, though, is that though even though the force corrects the lopsided drama, it makes the token economy even <em>more</em> lopsided, and counters are even worse. The lopsided economy spirals out of control making it more and more lopsided, causing more and more forces, until the session ends and the econ resets.<br/><br/><strong>Instead</strong>, have the two-spend and three-spend go to the bank instead of to that player.<br/><br/>I.e. new econ as follows:<br/><br/>When you give in (naturally or by being forced or countered) you gain one.<br/><br/>When the scene ends naturally and you don\u2019t give in, you lose one (if you have any).<br/><br/>If you want to force instead of ending the scene naturally you can spend two (to the bank) and when you want to counter you can spend three (to the bank).<br/><br/>This should choke out the econ but that\u2019s by intent; leaving the econ as a minimal safety valve on the natural flow of scenes.<br/><br/><small>Currently, in our group, we\u2019re not really all on the same page on whether or not the \u201cforces\u201d are worth it since they are so jarring. So our current rule is that we are experimenting with not using them, since we have lots of procedural scenes anyway, giving in gives you a reward that\u2019s usable in the procedural layer, and that in and of itself is hopefully incentive to give in. I still want to cook up some meaningful alternative to the \u201cforce\u201d rule for more pure drama based games because the whole \u201cmeaningful concession but not exactly what they asked for\u201d thing is so weird. All soap opera games: Smallville, Burning Wheel, TSoY, Monsterhearts etc all have this problem: you can get \u201cforced\u201d to have your character do something that you don\u2019t want them to do. [Not talking about vampire hypnosis or w/e, that\u2019s fine, I\u2019m talking about coming around emotionally.] Dogs though works because you can escalate. Either when you give in on the \u201ctalking\u201d arena, you\u2019re fine with giving in, or you escalate into an arena where you <i>are</i> fine with giving in.<br/><br/>Also our hillfolkery [within our D&amp;D game] has slowed a trickle this last half-a-year since I stopped \u201cbabysitting\u201d the reward of drama tokens. I wanted it to be more player-initiated since it started getting more and more fuzzy about what was a petition and what was just aimless needling or bullying. I wanted more clarity, them grabbing a token and going \u201cSo tell me about this plan of yours\u2026\u201d</small><br/><br/>One idea is this\u2026 instead of \u201cforcing\u201d\u2026<br/><br/>when the scene starts, you place a token from the bank between the two of you.<br/>You can take the tokens and give in. If you want to sweeten the deal, you can add more of your own tokens to the pot. Wordlessly. That can only work if we also find a usage for having a bunch of tokens.<br/>(Translating them to a procedural resource such as XP or HP is useless in a pure drama game.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite" title="AlexanderWhite"><img alt="AlexanderWhite" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite">AlexanderWhite</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485826/#Comment_485826" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-12T08:53:16+00:00" title="June 12, 2019  8:53AM">June 12</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What rules in  Monsterhearts have this problem?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite" title="AlexanderWhite"><img alt="AlexanderWhite" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite">AlexanderWhite</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485827/#Comment_485827" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-12T08:57:53+00:00" title="June 12, 2019  8:57AM">June 12</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Asking because I hate forces but didn\u2019t find it a problem in Monsterhearts, maybe the move \u2018call them on their shit\u2019 could be cleaned up a little.

I could see dramatically-minded players taking into account the token quantities when roleplaying their characters. ("Alice has lots of tokens right now, so she must be having a good hair day. I'm a sucker for nice hair!")<br/><br/>Personally, I'd want it to have more "teeth", just like you.<br/><br/>It's a common design problem with games that have such economies, in my experience. They need to be integrated with our game functions to remain salient.<br/><br/>What if you had some kind of status/affordance which had to do with token amounts? <br/><br/>A simple one might be "you can't be a petitioner in a scene if you don't have at least 3 tokens; otherwise, you can only refuse or grant other characters' petitions". So, now, the people with 3+ tokens are the ones who run the show and get to follow their agenda; the others just react, and, at best, get to keep what they already have.<br/><br/>Another could be something like, "the person with the most tokens always gets the last word", or whatever aspect of your roleplay you can imagine it being interesting to place some constraints on.<br/><br/>What if the GM had a rule where they can only create a new scene with the characters who have the most tokens? <br/><br/>Or anything that's bad that happens, happens to the person with the least tokens? (Fate turns against them, enemies decide to finally take action, etc.)<br/><br/>Making it GM-facing could take the pressure off the roleplaying concerns for the players, if that's desired.<br/><br/>Just spitballing here; I have no idea what the content of your dramatic gaming is like, really, so I doubt any of these are actually good ideas for you, but maybe one will inspire something. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485931/#Comment_485931" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-13T04:45:00+00:00" title="June 13, 2019  4:45AM">June 13</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                             "Whoever has the more tokens at the end of session has the more tokens at the end of session." is enough with some players but "richest sets the scene" is nice too !                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485943/#Comment_485943" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-13T06:12:28+00:00" title="June 13, 2019  6:12AM">June 13</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>A simple one might be "you can't be a petitioner in a scene if you don't have at least 3 tokens;</p></div></blockquote>\nMessing with the scene econ!!
