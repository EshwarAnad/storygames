I've been working on a hack for the system that will shift the focus to human rogues in a (non-magical) fantasy city.<br/><br/>I wanted to design a game that pushed hard toward the Picaresque genre.  The attached documents include the current state of the rules and character sheet.  I cut a lot of elements from Goblinville (basically everything about inventory, time, and explorations) and added a procedure for players to set their own scenes that I hope gives enough concrete context while allowing them to pursue their own agendas.  It is a very different game.<br/><br/>I'd love any feedback but I'm focused on a few things:<br/>- Are these procedures clear enough that you can imagine the flow of play?<br/>- Are the grudges and ambitions an interesting enough framework to catch your interest?<br/>- Are the minimal setting details appreciated or would you want more of a 'canon' setting?<br/>- Are the opportunities for advancement and progress sufficient to encourage multiple sessions of play?<br/><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T0oRdRkL2REW5RxxTs0fwCAnfqjJ-5-G/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Rules v2</a><br/><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wN-UqBWbFe2eiMa2-XDvRwdxrJIOs9iZ/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Sheets v2</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481781/#Comment_481781" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-09T18:37:44+00:00" title="April  9, 2019  6:37PM">April 9</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is an exciting prospect.

It reads well. <br/><br/>First the hiccups : <br/><br/>I am stopped by this "they say what location they choose a rogue and one of that rogue\u2019s locations."<br/><br/>Scene ends when "The immediate crisis is resolved" is harsh. Postponed and stalled won't do ? That can hurt...<br/><br/>You write as if the players would introduce NPCs and not the GM. I would make a move for the GM to introduce intermediaries (henchman, procuress, lawyer, moneylender, etc.) For reincorporation I would state that what turned good will later turn bad, and what turned bad will later turn good, so this intermediaries are mere farce, and won't change the stakes, only disturb the broth. But I suspect you need the GM to be harsher than that because of the game's economy.<br/><br/>For a campaign, I love the locations, but would like a table for intermediate goals, be them resting actions. Fashion is not enough to explore character. <br/><br/>I suggest jumping to "picarro" or "busca vida" or "hidalgo" right in the first paragraph, to seta el tone y el accento. Like in 7 samurais not all samurais are nobles, likewise not all picarros (scamps) are hidalgos (sons of something). I always assume that they are lying about their origins, or half lying in the case of bastards, to have if only a remote chance of social elevation. Btw, spanish for Great would be Gran, but Grand sounds nice too. And the game's not set in Spain, so, there's that, too. ;p<br/><br/>Typos<br/>With a subject of that sort, there will be some confusion between rogue and rouge (Find+replace). <br/>solely (to) undermine<br/>temper(a)ment,<br/>For another picarro (not "Goblin")<br/>one experience (not 2 "experience"s)<br/>Find+replace double spaces (maybe it's only your font settings that make some huge spaces).<br/><br/>The subject is novel, the mechanics easy to picture. Your version of Harm resolves a problem recurring in many games. I specially like locations and fashion for setting the theatricality level.<br/><br/>Now, could I choose "any balcony" as a location for my character ? ;p                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481866/#Comment_481866" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-11T15:30:25+00:00" title="April 11, 2019  3:30PM">April 11</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't forget to check this, forumites.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481867/#Comment_481867" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-11T15:40:28+00:00" title="April 11, 2019  3:40PM">April 11</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to do a second pass on Picaresque this weekend, and incorporate more of your advice <a href="/forums/profile/DeReel">@DeReel</a>.<br/><br/>The thing I'm thinking about first is introducing new NPCs:<br/><br/>A player may introduce a new NPC once for each of their own scenes, with the caveat that this NPC <i>hates</i> your rogue.

They could be a rival with the same goal, a friend cautioning against rash action, or an old acquaintance with an axe to grind.<br/><br/>Whenever possible, reincorporate a character rather than inventing someone new.  It will provide a greater sense of continuity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482181/#Comment_482181" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-20T19:37:31+00:00" title="April 20, 2019  7:37PM">April 20</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edited mostly by simplifying and refining the focus of play.

That may or may not be sufficient for your design goals!
