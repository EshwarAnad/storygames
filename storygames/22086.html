The clock on the wall in mom\u2019s kitchen says it\u2019s eight PM. The time in the magical realm of Gondor is just at the crack of dawn, outside the bandit camp. The diegetical time is just at the crack of dawn, not eight PM.\n<h2 id="contrasted-to-dice">Contrasted to \u201cDice\u201d</h2>Related concepts, sometimes conflated (including by me <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23SloppyAcademic2097&amp;Mode=like">#SloppyAcademic2097</a> ) are the Shared Imagined Space (the \u201cSIS\u201d) and the \u201cCloud\u201d, the latter most prominently used in <a href="/forums/profile/lumpley">@lumpley</a> \u2019s <a href="http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/599" rel="nofollow">dice and cloud series</a> from ten years ago; which contrasted it with \u201cdice\u201d, a word that means not only dice but also character sheets, numbers, pencils, special abilities, hit points, stats etc.\n<h2 id="contrasted-to-mimesis">Contrasted to mimesis</h2>In classical theatre, and in literary criticism, diegesis (which, in that context, means \u201cnarrated stuff\u201d) is contrasted to mimesis, which, in that context, means \u201cshown stuff\u201d \u2014 \u201cmimicking\u201d is based on the same word, it means imitation).<br/><br/>In many other media, including tabletop RPG and movies, this distinction has often fallen away and the distinction isn\u2019t really being made (including by me <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23SloppyAcademic2097&amp;Mode=like">#SloppyAcademic2097</a> ).<br/><br/>The first time I heard the word \u201cdiegetical\u201d it was in the context of \u201cdiegetical music is movie music that both the audience and the movie characters hear, maybe they have the radio on in the kitchen and dance to it; extradiegetical music is movie music that only the audience hear \u2014 subtle romantic notes as the two main leads first see each other\u201d.<br/><br/>Arguably if people are LARPing out game scenes and <em>showing</em> each other what they do, that\u2019s mimesis rather than diegesis. So maybe that\u2019s a distinction that will be brought back in the future but if you\u2019re digging through old threads don\u2019t worry about it, it\u2019s all the same fuzzy fancy way of saying \u201cin-game\u201d.\n<h2 id="why-not-just-say-in-game-then">Why not just say \u201cin-game\u201d then?</h2>This is kind of a selfish reason but the first couple of times I was legit confused. I mistakenly though this: We are sitting around a game table in a game room and we are a game group; aren\u2019t all of our activities, including mom\u2019s wall clock, \u201cin-game\u201d? And, similarly, the \u201cdice\u201d stuff (see above) is <em>definitely</em> part of the game activity but is still not necessarily diegetical.<br/><br/>So I needed a specific, dedicated word and the phrase from the sound track industry came to mind. (This was like decades ago.)<br/><br/>I later learned of the terms \u201ccloud\u201d and the \u201cSIS\u201d and sometimes use those words instead. Sorry about that.\u2665\n<h2 id="update-about-the-term-sis">Update about the term \u201cSIS\u201d</h2>In the past, I\u2019ve used the term SIS a lot for the diegesis, like, a <em>lot</em>, and I can\u2019t rellay go back and edit all those posts, but starting now, I\u2019ll stop using it. Here\u2019s where I went wrong.<br/><br/>I\u2019ve learned (in this thread) that people are really hung up on the \u201cShared\u201d part of the term SIS (Shared Imagined Space). Re-reading old Forge stuff, they\u2019re not wrong. But, I\u2019ll explain myself.<br/><br/>When I heard the word \u201cShared\u201d, I thought of the Swedish word \u201cgemensam\u201d. Something you have together. Me and my sister can share a book even though I haven\u2019t read all of it. <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/shared" rel="nofollow">Wiktionary says</a>:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Wiktionary" rel="nofollow">Wiktionary</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><h3 id="adjective">Adjective</h3><dl><dt><strong>shared</strong> <em>(not comparable)</em></dt><dd>Used by multiple entities or for multiple purposes or in multiple ways. quotations</dd></dl><h4 id="synonyms">Synonyms</h4><ul><li><em>(multiple entities)</em>: common, mutual</li></ul></div></blockquote>Now, I\u2019m <em>not</em> trying to do an \u201cwell, <em>actually</em>, the dictionary says so-and-so, so that\u2019s what you meant when you said shared\u201d. Uh, no. If that\u2019s not what they meant, it\u2019s not what they meant. But\u2026 it\u2019s what <strong>I</strong> meant when using the word shared imagined space up until the last week or so.<br/><br/>In my view of the phrase \u201cSIS\u201d, I thought it meant \u201cOK, we have this imagined space together. It\u2019s shared by us. The red ball in the chest is part of this shared imagined space even though the chest hasn\u2019t been opened so people don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a red ball in there.\u201d<br/><br/>What some of the Forge nerds sometimes meant by \u201cShared\u201d was specifically things that have been shared in <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/share#Verb" rel="nofollow">sense four in this definition</a>, while I thought they meant sense two. Which to me with my background in semiotics, sense two would\u2019ve made a hell of a lot more sense!<br/><br/>But in this sense-four \u201cShared Imagined Space\u201d, the red ball is not part of the SIS because it hasn\u2019t been told-about (\u201cshared\u201d sense four) even though it\u2019s a relevant part of our common imagination (sense two).<br/><br/>Through these last few weeks of debate, I\u2019ve, confusingly enough, gradually shifted my use of SIS over to the Forge \u201csense four\u201d usage <strong>in order to contrast it with my own use of \u201cdiegesis\u201d and \u201ccanon\u201d and \u201cgamestate\u201d and/or whatever we\u2019re calling it today since we apparently can\u2019t call it SIS</strong> because of this \u201csense-four-only usage\u201d.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483675/#Comment_483675" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-18T18:17:20+00:00" title="May 18, 2019  6:17PM">May 18</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>I later learned of the terms \u201ccloud\u201d and the \u201cSIS\u201d and sometimes use those words instead.

"In-game" is used in the way you describe by most/many gamers, but I agree that it's handy to have a term that distinguishes, say, rolling an actual die on the table from the fictional action that's being imagined.<br/><br/>I like Vincent's "dice" and "cloud", but that also has room for being confusing, since one is a synecdoche and the other a metaphor.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>Arguably if people are LARPing out game scenes and <em>showing</em> each other what they do, that\u2019s mimesis rather than diegesis. </p></div></blockquote>\nAn interesting point!

Your clarification, once I can internalize it to the point of consistency, will, I believe, be a big help in my own particular hobby horse.  Especially WRT to how dice fit into the game play process.  FREX - I would now argue that the die much closer to being mimetic than diegetic.  They aren't being used so much as part of an extradiegetical process (FREX - task resolution) but rather a reflection of the fickle hand of fate mimetically (Something is happening, to use that old term, in the SIS.  I know, the wrong term but old habits are hard to break).<br/><br/>Thank you!<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483694/#Comment_483694" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-18T21:10:02+00:00" title="May 18, 2019  9:10PM">May 18</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've sometimes thought the same thing; they are just as much "in-game" as the diegesis is                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483698/#Comment_483698" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-19T00:15:35+00:00" title="May 19, 2019 12:15AM">May 19</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>So I needed a specific, dedicated word and the phrase from the sound track industry came to mind.

So you were the one who bring the 'term' diegesis/diegetic into the RPG fields?<br/><br/>I've always thought that it came from the Knutepunkt people as in<i>The<br/>Meilahti Model</i> (2003) from  Stenros &amp; Hakkarainen:\n<blockquote>A role-playing game is what is created in the interaction between players or between player(s) and gamemaster(s) within a specified diegetic framework.<br/>[...]<br/>Diegesis is what is true within the game. Usually this means the game world. The diegetic frame is composed of what is true in the past (history of the frame and the characters), what the present is, and the expectations of the characters regarding the future. The gamemaster creates the diegetic frame and enunciates it in the depth that is necessary and possible.</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483712/#Comment_483712" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-19T05:38:54+00:00" title="May 19, 2019  5:38AM">May 19</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I started using it in 1999 and I had a lot of friends who went to Knutepunkt around that time;<br/>otoh it's such an obvious word for it so there may very well be parallel development.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483713/#Comment_483713" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-19T05:47:00+00:00" title="May 19, 2019  5:47AM">May 19</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I met some scholarly LARP nerds / Knutepunkt regulars [who soon after that joined up with &amp; introduced me to the Interacting Arts set] in <i>late</i> 2003 and taught them this usage of diegetic around then; so if that book was published earlier, S&amp;H prob got it from somewhere else.

I mean, it's totally true that what's inside a setting book is <i>not</i> part of the SIS in Forgite analysis, but it is part of a more nebulously defined idea of "this fictional thing we're engaged with". It's very important for the Big Model whether something is factually being imagined and communicated by somebody, or if it's just something that potentially exists in the play tools and background of the players.<br/><br/>When I first encountered "diegesis" in this context (I think it was at Ropecon in say 2003, one of the Finnish Nordic-style theorists giving a lecture on it) it was defined, if I remember correctly, the same as SIS: the actual actively created imagination space at the game table. I at least remember thinking that it seemed like a different word for the same concept.<br/><br/>I can't off-hand name any theory jargon framework that would have a word that clearly encompasses both the fiction present between the players and the fiction present in the GM's notes. "Setting" and similar terms of art come closest in bridging the gap. Probably it's just that everybody who starts thinking carefully figures out that they're two different things before they've come up with an encompassing name for both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483763/#Comment_483763" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-19T22:27:05+00:00" title="May 19, 2019 10:27PM">May 19</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2019 10:28PM by AsIf.">edited May 19</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's true, I can't think of a word anyone's coined for that hybrid/aggregate of content both in play and at-hand.

One model that was proposed was three layered - Authoring, Fabula and Syuzhet.<br/><br/>For myself, if it matters, the Shared Imagined Space contains only that information that has been proposed and accepted via the Lumpley Principle.  It is composed only of facts.  What we as individual players <i>think</i> about the facts - <br/><br/>Alice - "Carol was murdered!"<br/>Bob - "No, Ted was only actinging in self-defense!"<br/><br/>- is not the contained within the SIS but is part of what makes role-play so much fun.  The ruminating about what happened, responding emotionally as players, etc. is not part of the SIS anymore than the DM reading a book and <i>planning</i> on introducing Elves into the game some time in the future.  Intentionality (I'm going to reveal I'm vampire three games from now) and acting as an audience member responding to the developing fact space are not part of the SIS.<br/><br/>I don't want to say the SIS is all.  Not in the least.  These other layers that wrap around the SIS are the Awesome Sauce!  I just don't have any idea what these might be called.  I tried once and was embarrassed when I had posted with the complete wrong understandings of the words.  I'll leave that to the experts.

No believing in dragons! All good there. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>What I mean is: *that particular green dragon* was not part of the diegesis/gamestate/SIS/whatever, until that roll was made. There was no guarantee that roll would be made; it happened as a result of following certain procedures at the table.<br/><br/>So, we can have a dungeon with a "vorpal sword" written down in prep, and a set of random tables which could be used for encounters which includes the possibility of a green dragon. Clearly, the "vorpal sword" is "real" in the sense of being part of the "offscreen gamestate", but the dragon is not, right?*<br/><br/>Now, we play the game. The PCs enter the room with the vorpal sword, and the GM starts describing the room... but then someone says, "Hang on! We forgot to roll for a random encounter!" <br/><br/>Oh no! We pause that narration (no sword has been described yet), and we roll. A green dragon comes up! The PCs fight the dragon and many cool things happen. The GM is about to get back to describing the contents of the room, including the vorpal sword, but then the phone rings and someone has to go to work early! We agree to wrap up the campaign there, and then, sadly, by the time out next session comes around, the GM has moved to Florida (why? oh why?). So we continue playing, but with Julian GMing, instead, and we embark on an entirely different adventure, having left those caverns behind.<br/><br/>Now imagine an alternative version, where there is a Reaction Check (this particular group plays old-school!), and the green dragon gets a Very Friendly result. Thinking this over, Bob the Fighter realizes that his father had mentioned something about rescuing a green dragon hatchling 50 years ago! Oh, wow! Surely, this might be *that very dragon*! Otherwise, how do you explain a green dragon suddenly being all friendly? It must be because it recognizes Bob's heritage! (Maybe he smells like his dad, or something.)<br/><br/>Everyone's laughing, and the idea is so clear and so *right* that no one dares ruin the moment: clearly this is what the gloracle has said.<br/><br/>So!<br/><br/>As far as the prep is concerned, the vorpal sword was "there", right? And was there a friendly green dragon wandering around the dungeon? Not in the same sense as the sword, not at all.<br/><br/>But, as far as what happened diegetically/in the fiction/at the table/in the SIS, the friendly-dragon-that-Bob's-dad-rescued-long-ago is far more "real" than the vorpal sword, which, as far as we are concerned, never existed at all. (It would be pretty hard to explain why, if it had existed and was in that room, the PCs would have left without taking it with them, even if we someday found the module's text and tried to retcon the whole thing...)<br/><br/>I think that illustrates the difference between "offscreen gamestate" and "SIS" pretty clearly.<br/><br/>We can now extend that analogy further - what if this GM doesn't have a random encounter table for this region, and has to make up one, as a tier 3 truth? (Oops! Better make a table for the next session, right? But there's still a dragon in our game now.)<br/><br/><i>What if the GM has poor eyesight and the light was dim and she misread the entry entirely, and it actually said "green goblin"?</i><br/><br/>And so on.<br/><br/><br/>(*:  As a sidenote, I'm aware - and sometimes use - a different approach, where random encounter tables are "populated" with entities actually assumed to be "in the area"; and as they are killed or driven away, they are removed from those tables. That's a different thing! Cool, but different. I'm thinking more of a scenario where there is a book of random tables which the GM could pull out to generate random encounters, like "Randolpho the Mad's Tome of Random Encounters, volume 3".)

Here\u2019s where I went wrong.<br/><br/>I\u2019ve learned (in this thread) that people are really hung up on the \u201cShared\u201d part of the term SIS (Shared Imagined Space). Re-reading old Forge stuff, they\u2019re not wrong. But, I\u2019ll explain myself.<br/><br/>When I heard the word \u201cShared\u201d, I thought of the Swedish word \u201cgemensam\u201d. Something you have together. Me and my sister can share a book even though I haven\u2019t read all of it. <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/shared" rel="nofollow">Wiktionary says</a>:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Wiktionary" rel="nofollow">Wiktionary</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><h3 id="adjective">Adjective</h3><dl><dt><strong>shared</strong> <em>(not comparable)</em></dt><dd>Used by multiple entities or for multiple purposes or in multiple ways. quotations</dd></dl><h4 id="synonyms">Synonyms</h4><ul><li><em>(multiple entities)</em>: common, mutual</li></ul></div></blockquote>Now, I\u2019m <em>not</em> trying to do an \u201cwell, <em>actually</em>, the dictionary says so-and-so, so that\u2019s what you meant when you said shared\u201d. Uh, no. If that\u2019s not what they meant, it\u2019s not what they meant. But\u2026 it\u2019s what <strong>I</strong> meant when using the word shared imagined space up until the last week or so.<br/><br/>In my view of the phrase \u201cSIS\u201d, I thought it meant \u201cOK, we have this imagined space together. It\u2019s shared by us. The red ball in the chest is part of this shared imagined space even though the chest hasn\u2019t been opened so people don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a red ball in there.\u201d<br/><br/>What some of the Forge nerds sometimes meant by \u201cShared\u201d was specifically things that have been shared in <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/share#Verb" rel="nofollow">sense four in this definition</a>, while I thought they meant sense two. Which to me with my background in semiotics, sense two would\u2019ve made a hell of a lot more sense!<br/><br/>But in this sense-four \u201cShared Imagined Space\u201d, the red ball is not part of the SIS because it hasn\u2019t been told-about (\u201cshared\u201d sense four) even though it\u2019s a relevant part of our common imagination (sense two).<br/><br/>Through these last few weeks of debate, I\u2019ve, confusingly enough, gradually shifted my use of SIS over to the Forge \u201csense four\u201d usage <strong>in order to contrast it with my own use of \u201cdiegesis\u201d and \u201ccanon\u201d and \u201cgamestate\u201d and/or whatever we\u2019re calling it today since we apparently can\u2019t call it SIS</strong> because of this \u201csense-four-only usage\u201d.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485541/#Comment_485541" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-07T08:41:32+00:00" title="June  7, 2019  8:41AM">June 7</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Background in semiotics or not, thinking of diegesis as "always already mutual" is a very DM point of view.

Real life analogy intended.</p></div></blockquote>I wholly disagree with this post.<br/><br/>I want a <em>symmetry</em> in how established the contents of that chest is. In the blorb model, both the DM and the player treat that content (the red ball) as if it is established, it\u2019s just that the player hasn\u2019t opened the chest yet and don\u2019t know about the ball. It\u2019s established to them <em>as an unknown</em>.<br/><br/>In the \u201cno myth\u201d model, when using traditional techniques, the player is expected to treat the chest content as if it were something established. The GM though can hold it lightly and decide later what it is. This is also why I specified that this model is problematic only with traditional techniques. In a hippiefied game there\u2019s no problem for the player to treat the chest contents as \u201csomething to be established later\u201d. <strong>Even if the player has understood the proverbial two-minute conversation</strong> [i.e.\xa0they\u2019re not me because I\u2019m not smart enough to fully internalize the essential ephemerical nature of the world around me in just two minutes, I guess I work similarly to the \u201cBeliefs\u201d/\u201cnot what my character would do\u201d player in Deliverator\u2019s example earlier], but even if a hypothetical player <em>has</em> understood that: when using traditional techniques, <strong>they are expected to pretend to treat the [to them unknown] chest contents <em>as if</em> it was established and immutable</strong> even though they know that it\u2019s not.<br/><br/>In the blorb model where elements can be introduced into the diegesis \u201coff-screen\u201d <em>and become immutable</em> the DM is <em>inherently more restricted</em> and therefor their power is <em>inherently more constrained</em> than in the no-myth model where they have more power of what\u2019s canon since it doens\u2019t become canon until it\u2019s spoken out loud.<br/><br/>In a blorb game, both the players and DM are bound to treat the diegesis \u201cwith respect\u201d [i.e.\xa0through an interface].<br/>Player\u2019s interface: their character\u2019s actions &amp; statements, i.e. \u201cI open the chest\u201d<br/>DM\u2019s interface: the gloracle, i.e. \u201cthe chest has a red ball\u201d<br/><br/>When <strong>being a player</strong> in a \u201cno-myth\u201d game, I\u2019m like \u201cwait, why do I need to use this restricted interface just to talk to you and make up a story together with you? You\u2019re not treating the world as canon so why do I have to? Why can\u2019t I say I open the chest and take out the candlestick in there? That\u2019ll flow much better too instead of having to ask you what\u2019s in it.\u201d Hence a desire for hippiefication. Conversely, when being a player in a blorb game I\u2019m like \u201cOK I want to veeeery carefully, with the edge of my sword, my right arm is outstretched, open that chest\u201d. Or whatever. I kinda automatically start treating the world with respect and the dangers in it with respect, and by \u201crespect\u201d I mean I treat it something that is separate from just the words we are saying right now. Which, in a blorb game, <em>it is</em>.

To reiterate: the Blorbella technique means that <em>only the entries that are actually rolled</em> are injected into the canon.<br/><br/>For example, I\u2019ll start a campaign like this: \u201cNot sure if there\u2019s gonna be D&amp;D, they seemed more into board games, I\u2019ll just put a couple of minutes into prep\u2026 OK, I have these four modules [usually tiny little lairs or one-pagers] and this little six-entry table of encounters for the wilderness between them, to represent things that are definitely roaming around in there. <strong>If</strong> they ignore the lairs completely and just spend the session doing wilderness stuff and mine up that table, I\u2019ll just use the Blorbella technique.\u201d (and committing to which specific table out of Blorbella\u2019s that is in use.)<br/><br/>This idea of \u201cfallbacks\u201d is so great because it helps us align our two otherwise incompatible goals: prepping very solidly, <em>and</em> prepping very widely.<br/><br/>(Also, normally, I wouldn\u2019t have the a solid sword and a Blorbella dragon in the same room. Would more likely been that the room content was also from Blorbella\u2019s. (She has rooms and treasures and stuff too.) But that\u2019s a nitpick within another nitpick.)<br/><br/>So. With that in mind, and not overestimating how often we use the Blorbella technique, you are right that it\u2019s a non-zero amount.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485678/#Comment_485678" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-10T09:16:21+00:00" title="June 10, 2019  9:16AM">June 10</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<em>[Story about how a sword was a tier 1 truth and a green dragon was a tier two truth.]</em>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>As far as the prep is concerned, the vorpal sword was \u201cthere\u201d, right?

In games that lean into narrative, a scene is generally completed by the resolution of a key procedural intention, a dramatic gambit or a "beat" (ie, an emotionally significant measure of progress or setback), thereby resolving the situation in one way or another.  In some systems (<i>DramaSystem,</i> for example) the gambit or intention is stated ahead of playing it out, making it somewhat easier to tell when the scene has reached its end.<br/><br/>In games that lean away from narrativism, it's probably easier to consider the scene's end to be the point at which the subject(s) of the scene leave the location and go to another.<br/><br/>ETA: It is possible - though not common - for a scene to cross more than one location.  In this case the narrative model is almost certainly being employed (think "training montage" for instance), and thus the scene is not necessarily limited by geographic concerns.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_486101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486101/#Comment_486101" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-15T02:05:52+00:00" title="June 15, 2019  2:05AM">June 15</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2019 2:09AM by Paul_T.">edited June 15</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Would you be so kind as to give an example of the second description.</p></div></blockquote>\nMy guess is:<br/><br/><i>You and I are standing on the bridge, trying to beat the spy into submission.

Yes, that theoretically  requires an act of judgement but delimiting locations is not a problem in practice (until I define a location as "the continent",  but this trick soon shows its limits).<br/>What people have trouble with is delimiting scenes because they add "goal" or "tension" as a criterion. Which is not what I do because I don't need to and find it troublesome. <br/>Sequence is a good term for "larger than scene" but is not useful. That's why I'd rather provide specific labels for each specific game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22086/the-diegesis-easily-explained" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22086/the-diegesis-easily-explained" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22086/the-diegesis-easily-explained/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F22086%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F22086%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
