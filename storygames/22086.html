Your clarification, once I can internalize it to the point of consistency, will, I believe, be a big help in my own particular hobby horse.  Especially WRT to how dice fit into the game play process.  FREX - I would now argue that the die much closer to being mimetic than diegetic.  They aren't being used so much as part of an extradiegetical process (FREX - task resolution) but rather a reflection of the fickle hand of fate mimetically (Something is happening, to use that old term, in the SIS.  I know, the wrong term but old habits are hard to break).<br/><br/>Thank you!<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483694/#Comment_483694" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-18T21:10:02+00:00" title="May 18, 2019  9:10PM">May 18</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've sometimes thought the same thing; they are just as much "in-game" as the diegesis is                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483698/#Comment_483698" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-19T00:15:35+00:00" title="May 19, 2019 12:15AM">May 19</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>So I needed a specific, dedicated word and the phrase from the sound track industry came to mind.

So you were the one who bring the 'term' diegesis/diegetic into the RPG fields?<br/><br/>I've always thought that it came from the Knutepunkt people as in<i>The<br/>Meilahti Model</i> (2003) from  Stenros &amp; Hakkarainen:\n<blockquote>A role-playing game is what is created in the interaction between players or between player(s) and gamemaster(s) within a specified diegetic framework.<br/>[...]<br/>Diegesis is what is true within the game. Usually this means the game world. The diegetic frame is composed of what is true in the past (history of the frame and the characters), what the present is, and the expectations of the characters regarding the future. The gamemaster creates the diegetic frame and enunciates it in the depth that is necessary and possible.</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483712/#Comment_483712" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-19T05:38:54+00:00" title="May 19, 2019  5:38AM">May 19</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I started using it in 1999 and I had a lot of friends who went to Knutepunkt around that time;<br/>otoh it's such an obvious word for it so there may very well be parallel development.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483713/#Comment_483713" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-19T05:47:00+00:00" title="May 19, 2019  5:47AM">May 19</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I met some scholarly LARP nerds / Knutepunkt regulars [who soon after that joined up with &amp; introduced me to the Interacting Arts set] in <i>late</i> 2003 and taught them this usage of diegetic around then; so if that book was published earlier, S&amp;H prob got it from somewhere else.

Much of what made the '00s so enchanting (read: terrible) here in Finland had its origins in rigorous disagreements between what amounts to a bunch of Forgites vs. a bunch of Nordic immersionists. Sort of like the RPGnet reaction to the Forge, except there's two crazy theory cults spreading their gospel at the same time.<br/><br/>Interesting to hear about the origin of  "diegetic" - I knew that it was adopted for rpg use in that scene, but didn't know who might've taken it up originally.<br/><br/>"Diegesis" is pretty much the same thing as "shared imagined space", if one is inclined to translate jargon between traditions.

I mean, it's totally true that what's inside a setting book is <i>not</i> part of the SIS in Forgite analysis, but it is part of a more nebulously defined idea of "this fictional thing we're engaged with". It's very important for the Big Model whether something is factually being imagined and communicated by somebody, or if it's just something that potentially exists in the play tools and background of the players.<br/><br/>When I first encountered "diegesis" in this context (I think it was at Ropecon in say 2003, one of the Finnish Nordic-style theorists giving a lecture on it) it was defined, if I remember correctly, the same as SIS: the actual actively created imagination space at the game table. I at least remember thinking that it seemed like a different word for the same concept.<br/><br/>I can't off-hand name any theory jargon framework that would have a word that clearly encompasses both the fiction present between the players and the fiction present in the GM's notes. "Setting" and similar terms of art come closest in bridging the gap. Probably it's just that everybody who starts thinking carefully figures out that they're two different things before they've come up with an encompassing name for both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483763/#Comment_483763" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-19T22:27:05+00:00" title="May 19, 2019 10:27PM">May 19</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2019 10:28PM by AsIf.">edited May 19</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's true, I can't think of a word anyone's coined for that hybrid/aggregate of content both in play and at-hand.

One model that was proposed was three layered - Authoring, Fabula and Syuzhet.<br/><br/>For myself, if it matters, the Shared Imagined Space contains only that information that has been proposed and accepted via the Lumpley Principle.  It is composed only of facts.  What we as individual players <i>think</i> about the facts - <br/><br/>Alice - "Carol was murdered!"<br/>Bob - "No, Ted was only actinging in self-defense!"<br/><br/>- is not the contained within the SIS but is part of what makes role-play so much fun.  The ruminating about what happened, responding emotionally as players, etc. is not part of the SIS anymore than the DM reading a book and <i>planning</i> on introducing Elves into the game some time in the future.  Intentionality (I'm going to reveal I'm vampire three games from now) and acting as an audience member responding to the developing fact space are not part of the SIS.<br/><br/>I don't want to say the SIS is all.  Not in the least.  These other layers that wrap around the SIS are the Awesome Sauce!  I just don't have any idea what these might be called.  I tried once and was embarrassed when I had posted with the complete wrong understandings of the words.  I'll leave that to the experts.  However that we're both audience and creators at the same time (or interwoven time) makes this a very different beast.<br/><br/>If it's not <i>shared</i> then its not part of the Shared Imagined Space.<br/><br/>Ducking away as I'm sure I've made of mess of things on this topic again...<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483783/#Comment_483783" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-20T04:55:53+00:00" title="May 20, 2019  4:55AM">May 20</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            True, the "shared" part of the SIS <i>is</i> a difference                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
