It's for a print-on-demand version of Soth, a game where you play evil cultists in a small town secretly trying to summon a dark god. Problem is, your friends, family and co-workers are all incredibly nosy ... which'll make it difficult to get away with your murderous rituals.<br/><br/>We funded in 11 hours and now we're on to our third stretch goal. <br/><br/>The kickstarter is here: <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2025062091/soth-a-game-of-cultists-vs-investigators" rel="nofollow">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2025062091/soth-a-game-of-cultists-vs-investigators</a><br/><br/>Soth is a diceless RPG. It\u2019s a cousin of Apocalypse World, in that it uses hard and soft moves and \u2018the game as a conversation\u2019 as its foundation rather than playbooks and 2d6+stat rolls.<br/><br/>If the cultists act in a way that draws attention to themselves, the GM earns "Suspicion". Suspicion is spent to trigger hard moves - like \u2018creating an investigator\u2019 or \u2018having an investigator find the temple\u2019.<br/><br/>Happy to chat about it, but check it out it if a game that feels like the Coen Brothers directed a Lovecraft adaptation is your kind of thing.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_480915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480915/#Comment_480915" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-03T18:41:10+00:00" title="March  3, 2019  6:41PM">March 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds cool \u2014 there\u2019s a Fiasco playbook with a similar scenario, but this would be a bit crunchier.

Each character has a daily obligation they have to meet to avoid suspicion, as well as a compulsion they have to perform. There's a rule called the 'Mask of Sanity' which proscribes behaviours the cultists have to do if they have a lengthy conversation with someone.<br/><br/>My favourite rule is that table-talk is totally allowed. It just gives the GM a bunch of Suspicion they can spend later. <br/><br/>All the rules work together to create a really interesting dynamic at the table: everyone's trying their best while simultaneously compromising their goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DBB" title="DBB"><img alt="DBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/542/nRJ4FIVD3GGO6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DBB">DBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481050/#Comment_481050" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-05T22:11:22+00:00" title="March  5, 2019 10:11PM">March 5</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks really fun!
