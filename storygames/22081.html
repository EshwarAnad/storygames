Just looking for a person who gets along with my group and can play most weeks. We usually play on weekends around 6pm (Pacific Standard Time). We play Burning Wheel, Fate: Accelerated, Apocalypse World, and Pendragon. (Actually, we\u2019ve never played Pendragon\u2026 I just like talking about us playing The Great Pendragon Campaign one day.)  In general, our campaigns are pretty campy. Sincere fantasy names are usually avoided. No archaisms or ye-old peasant talk. Trope and genre awareness are welcome. We try not to avoid melodrama, the irony and campiness are really meant to make giving dramatic monologues less awkward for everyone. We\u2019re all emotionally insecure man-children, so it might help to be one too.<br/><br/>We have a rule: \u201cShm-\u201c makes anything fantasy. You can use it to make pop culture references, as in \u201cShmaristotle once said\u2026\u201d or \u201c\u2019Know thyself\u2019 \u2013 Shmocrates\u201d. It\u2019s so characters aren\u2019t stuck referencing only the three books previously set up in game. GM can veto in order to maintain world logic, of course.<br/><br/>That\u2019s probably enough of that. Send me a pm and tell me a little about yourself. I won\u2019t subject you to any interview questions, but generally I get along better with people who care about art is some form, so if you want to mention books, movies, or music you like, I\u2019d be interested. We can set up a one-off session and also make some time for everyone to talk and get to know each other first. The ideal is finding someone cool to play with long-term. (Technically, I\u2019d also be interested in hearing from new players, but I\u2019m really tired of GMing so that\u2019s the priority.)<br/><br/>Sorry if I'm posting in the wrong place with this. If there's other places I should try posting, I'd very much appreciate that information.
