I\u2019d love to see that! Always a challenge to get people together. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></p></div></blockquote><p>They\u2019re kinda complicated.</p><p>We have \u201cmain day\u201d and \u201cextra days\u201d. I\u2019m gonna start how we determine \u201cmain days\u201d.</p><p>So first of all we use a fork of dudle.rb, which in turn was an unofficial clone of the \u201cDoodle\u201d scheduling software. It\u2019s a grid: proposed dates along the X axis, people along the Y axis. You put in your name on a row and for each column you check \u201cyes\u201d, \u201cmaybe\u201d, or \u201cno.\u201d</p><p>The polls come up (through the life-changing magic of <code>cron</code> jobs) every Monday morning at 1000. The polls cover seven days, stretching from Wednesday to Tuesday <small>(this is confusing af, why oh why did I start the weeks at Wednesday, not a day go by when I don\u2019t regret that choice. And we have three players who hate the Wednesday start and one who insists on it. Changing would be a very big hassle at this point too)</small>; that means each poll come up 9 days before the first available day and 16 days before the last available day.</p><p>Then there are two deadlines. First deadline is Saturday evening at 2200. So people have over five days available to vote.</p><p>Then the preliminary date is selected using this kinda weird algo:</p><p>\u2714: 1 point<br/>+0.01 points for each \u2714 on the same horizontal line<br/>+0.001 point for each cell (regardless of symbol) directly vertically below it, and for each <strong>?</strong> on the same horizontal line<br/>\u2718: 0 points (or minus a thousand points if DM)<br/><strong>?</strong>: 0.1 points</p><p>I\u2019m gonna explain that exact same thing using other words, here:</p><p>Let\u2019s use an example where Alice proposed Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and Bob only proposed Tuesday.</p><p>First we look at which day has the most \u2714. If there\u2019s a tie for most, the first tiebreaker is most <strong>?</strong>. This means that in the \u201cAlice/Bob\u201d example, did any of the other people (Carol &amp; Ted for example) disambiguate which day to select? If they didn\u2019t, let\u2019s say that counting up \u2714 and <strong>?</strong> it\u2019s between Monday and Tuesday. Then we look at the second tiebreaker. Who has been most generous? In this case, clearly Alice. So it\u2019s gonna be Monday.</p><p>The fourth tiebreaker lends equal weight to voting early, and to being generous with <strong>?</strong>. In other words, it values generosity with \u2714 much more.</p><p>Then as a fifth tiebreaker (not using that point system), it\u2019s Sandra\u2019s favorite days! Which are Saturday, Sunday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday, Tuesday in that order. (Here\u2019s how I came up with that order: I like playing on weekends over weekdays, so Sat &amp; Sun are first, and I think scheduling the mainday earlier is better than later (helps wrt getting a lot of extra days in). And polls start on Wednesday which is why I value them higher than Thursdays.)</p><p>So <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/proposebot/" rel="nofollow">a bot</a> does that calculation for us on Saturday evening and reports his or her findings. (The bots post on our website using names cribbed randomly from a list of prominent NPCs the players have rescued/killed/been killed by/met/sassed.)</p><p>Then people whine and moan and complain and pester each other all through Sunday. I\u2019m usually in bed reading a book and/or dropping acid while this is going; it used to be worst day of week but now my robot overlord does it all\u2665</p><p>Then on Monday morning, at 1000 (same time as the next poll go up), the robot calls it.</p><p>The robot now has two \u201cgrids\u201d to work from. As it stood on Saturday evening, and as it stood on Monday morning.</p><p>Often the one on Monday morning has more voters (which the proposebot snarkily refers to as \u201clate contributors\u201d), people who came in on Sunday and kinda drunkenly voted. (Sorry, not sorry, Alice!)</p><p>But the Saturday votes carry a heck of a lot more weight. Vote on time next time, Alice!</p><p>If Saturday voters (people who voted on time) were convinced during The Great Sunday of Pleading to show mercy, and open up their votes, that can change the outcome significantly. Because the Monday vote uses a ternary IOR mask of the Saturday people\u2019s votes on Saturday and their votes on Monday. That means that if you have turned a \u2718 into a <strong>?</strong> or \u2714, or if they have turned a <strong>?</strong> into a \u2714, that is taken into account. If you have changed votes in the other direction, tough titties, that is ignored. The proposebot appreciated your original Saturday generosity and chooses to look the other way for your temporary stinginess in the Great Sunday War&amp;Quarrel.</p><p>However, the Monday schedule as a whole does serve one purpose. It changes the fifth tiebreaker (Sandra\u2019s ranked list of favorite days) to instead be \u201cWhat would the day have been if everyone voted in time?\u201d (Also the late votes are great because it gives something clear &amp; visual for the Sunday Arguments to be about.)</p><p>So the main day is selected (by bot) on Monday morning at 1000, two days before the first possible day for that poll.</p><p>I def need those two days so I can hook up with hot guys in jeans the rest of the week! Wouldn\u2019t want any empty slots in the calendar where I would have to \u201cread\u201d or \u201cknit\u201d or \u201cedition war\u201d.</p><p>Then we select extra days during a method that\u2019s kinda more complicated, called \u201ctalking to each other\u201d, and I\u2019m hoping to streamline it in the future. It\u2019s error prone and weird things come up in the last minute. But the bots ensure that we play at least once per week and it\u2019s usually two or three extra days on top of that.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483025/#Comment_483025" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-08T11:33:06+00:00" title="May  8, 2019 11:33AM">May 8</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't get misled by the self-deprecating jokes sprinkled throughout\u2014this is actually how we do it T_T<br/>yes i have a problem                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483051/#Comment_483051" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-09T01:45:51+00:00" title="May  9, 2019  1:45AM">May 9</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is spectacular!

Some of the players who have joined later haven\u2019t been through that to the same extent and are therefore occasionally starting it up with \u201cCan\u2019t we trust each other to roll our stats at home\u201d or w/e along with the old stand-by \u201cI trust everyone I\u2019m playing with because I wouldn\u2019t want to be playing with cheaters\u201d.
