Everything is tied to <b>your personal feelings</b> as a player AND character about what happened: this means that, knowing that you are going to die soon, you can choose whether to die full of spite or with a free soul. It's not really a "game" in the sense that you have something to score.<br/><br/>-MikeT<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_479896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/The_Bearded_Belgian" title="The_Bearded_Belgian"><img alt="The_Bearded_Belgian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Bearded_Belgian">The_Bearded_Belgian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479896/#Comment_479896" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-21T10:01:03+00:00" title="January 21, 2019 10:01AM">January 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I cannot download it right now but this is a message to follow this and so I don\u2019t forget to download it later.
