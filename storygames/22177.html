                    I'm heating up for a DitV game and found out a variation using <a href="https://app.box.com/s/a6gw0r5ics" rel="nofollow">fewer dice</a> (thanks <a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">@Aviatrix</a> ). I already customized the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OcDAVjZliiqn7aNhHwOhUpLbHa99dtRi" rel="nofollow">playbooks</a> with it based on some cool design I've found in the web (can't remember the author name, please if someone knows it, lemme know).<br/><br/>Anyway, my question is: have someone used this tweak, or played the game with fewer dice for themselves and if so, what are your thoughts on it? My intention is speeding up the conflict system for our first game on the basis that a) our timetable is tight, with just 3h on week days, and b) I know a couple members of the group are not big fans of dice manipulation games.<br/><br/>So that's it. Thanks in advance.<br/><br/>EDIT: Found it! It was <a href="/forums/profile/jenskot">@jenskot</a> who did the playbooks in this thread <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15367/lover-letter-to-vincent-baker-running-dogs-cons/p1" rel="nofollow">here</a>.                </div>

                            This is something I’ve given a fair bit of thought! It’s tricky. Sometimes conflicts feel “punchier” with fewer dice, and sometimes it seems like they go by too fast, with nothing to “hold onto”. If you only get two Raises each, it can feel insufficient and unsatisfying.<br/><br/>The main thing that drags down Dogs games, in my experience, is when people forget that they are allowed to “give” in conflicts. That’s really key to making the game work! <br/><br/>I watched Vincent Baker play once, and I was struck by something he did in the game:<br/><br/>He was portraying an NPC, and after the initial dice pool was rolled, he said: “I can see that toy have better dice, and I know [this NPC] isn’t willing to escalate, so I’m going to give right off the bat.”<br/><br/>Having that sort of insight, instead of stubbornly playing every conflict through to the last die remaining, really helps the game work.                         </div>

                            Thanks for the input, Paul. <br/><br/>I'm really undecided here. See, besides our tight playtime (3 hours), with the exception of 1 other player, my group is <b>super traditional</b> in their preferences, and I fear DitV dice play could be too much for them. <br/><br/>So I'm torn between: a) using the default rules in a very simple town (so we get less conflicts but crucial/long ones), or b) using the fewer dice variant on a normal town (so we have more conflicts, with faster duration each).<br/><br/>If you or someone else has more thoughts to give, I appreciate. Thanks!                        </div>

                            My experience is that having just a couple fewer dice in each conflict won't speed things up all that meaningfully. Kind of like how giving Fighters in your D&amp;D game multiple attacks sure *will* slow combat down a little, yes, technically, but hardly enough to be noticeable.<br/><br/>Feel free to try it, of course! But that's been my experience. Dealing with setting up the conflict, figuring out the stakes, collecting dice, thinking through what Traits and Belongings come into play, and whether the various parties will escalate or not, and then Fallout (plus potential healing conflicts!) all take far more time than an extra Raise or two once the conflict is under way.<br/><br/>I would choose to use fewer dice because I like how it *feels* (conflicts are punchier and more immediately decisive, perhaps, but less detailed and colourful), not because I need to speed up the game. It's an aesthetic/flavour/style choice, in other words.<br/><br/>Learning to go to conflicts very early, and giving as soon as it becomes reasonable to do so, will speed up your game far more. (And you should do that in any case.)                        </div>

                            Some further thoughts:<br/><br/>The "fewer dice" version has 2-3 fewer dice per participant per conflict or so (e.g. 11d for Stats instead 13d, of which one might come into play, plus maybe one fewer Trait). It's a pretty subtle difference: you might have four "rounds" of Raises and Sees instead of three, for example. If it feels good, do it! But short conflicts can also feel unsatisfying, so it's a tradeoff.<br/><br/>Another thing that really affects the duration of play is how hard you scene frame and <i>how many players there are</i>. DitV, as a game, is very sensitive to the number of players (especially if you're using the rules as written, in which you may need to design your Towns differently, as well, depending on how many Dogs there are).<br/><br/>One thing I saw Vincent do when he was running the game was NOT to let every Dog participate in every conflict. He'd just have one Dog lead the conflict, and the others could "help" if they were present. This balances the game and makes it move a lot faster, too, but could be unsatisfying for the players who end up on the sidelines.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Another note:<br/><br/>I looked at the "reduced dice" in the link, and they're nice in a lot of ways, but they don't balance as well between the different character backgrounds as the rules as-written do. That's not a huge deal, but I thought I'd point it out!                        </div>

                            Paul, thanks for the insight on what slows the game down. And yes, I've watched the session on Youtube with Vincent where they designate a lead Dog and the others help (instead of everybody participating in the same conflict). I'll be using this rule.<br/><br/>About the fewer dice playbook, I've notice the inconsistency in the originals. I've tweaked it since. Could you take a look and say what you think?<br/><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qaaN-dNkdG8XTlmEVCRfGdAJWLdTGvbM/view?usp=drivesdk" rel="nofollow">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qaaN-dNkdG8XTlmEVCRfGdAJWLdTGvbM/view?usp=drivesdk</a><br/><br/>Thanks!                        </div>
