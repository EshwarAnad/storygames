I found this cool picture in my Deviantart Notification Box and wondered what it would inspire in everyone if you looked at it. So here is the challenge. Make a short pitch for an adventure based upon <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/artofreza/art/Tower-798821348" rel="nofollow">this picture</a>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/The_Bearded_Belgian" title="The_Bearded_Belgian"><img alt="The_Bearded_Belgian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Bearded_Belgian">The_Bearded_Belgian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484660/#Comment_484660" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-30T10:04:12+00:00" title="May 30, 2019 10:04AM">May 30</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Xo-Zhal's Tower</b><br/><br/>"The king fell ill and there is no heir.
