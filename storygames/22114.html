Unless you do math ahead of time.<br/><br/>"Pass the pigs" has a similar math problem; I saw a paper where they had calculated out the optimal number to always go for / always stop at. The folk game "10000" similarly. By that measure, Zombie Dice is honestly a lot more nuanced since there is no "optimal number" because the dice have bag memory.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johann" title="Johann"><img alt="Johann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johann">Johann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484997/#Comment_484997" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-02T20:41:16+00:00" title="June  2, 2019  8:41PM">June 2</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Why is LCR popular?</p><p>High stakes (often real money), easy rules, no prestige, can do other things while playing w/o really caring, anti-elitist\u2026</p><p>What are some issues with LCR to keep in mind when trying to design an even better game?</p><p>To make it more engaging, more agential [some choices, and some design elements that lend meaning to those choices], less tedious&amp;rote, more varied\u2026</p><p></p></div></blockquote>\nI don't know what LCR is, but it seems to me that your "improvements" run counter to the qualities you identify.

Truly improving on a popular design in every way is a tall order. Off the top of my head, I can't think of any examples for RPGs or even video games (though I'd expect there to be some on account of clearer writing and technological advances alone, respectively).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485000/#Comment_485000" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-02T21:08:22+00:00" title="June  2, 2019  9:08PM">June 2</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            LCR is a terrible game.<br/>LCR can be a fine activity for the right crowd, right environment.
