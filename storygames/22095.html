This is common but I just Do Not Want. I don't have any problems with a game like Fiasco or <i>Nerver av st\xe5l</i> or Microscope. When those kinds of games appeared I thought they were cool.<br/><br/>Playing "Pathfinder with bangs" I think is bull. Adding bangs to a traditional game\u2014and I'd argue that's what Sorcerer does/is\u2014is something that does not sit well with me.<br/><br/>To me the pre-writing / frustrated author GMing style (story "before": gnusto) works best with a game set up around it (like Chuubo's if you want the players to write stories [which is cool], or something like Dread or some shit like that if you want the GM to write stories) and the story NOW (nitfol) goal works best with a game using completely alien &amp; non-traditional techniques.<br/><br/>And by "works best" I don't mean more effective. Not at all. What I do mean is that it's least likely to undermine the glory of blorb and the blorbiness of the gloracle.<br/><br/>Let me try another way: no-one is going to think the GM is railroading you in Microscope (also, there is no GM).<br/><br/>So I'm <i>not</i> saying that most narrativist games are using alien techniques. I am saying that story games that use alien techniques (typically but not necessarily GM-less being one of those techniques) are less threatening to me as a devotee of blorb.<br/><br/>With that said, finding which nitfol techniques work well <i>with</i> blorb without undermining it can enhance a blorb game a lot. There's nothing wrong with giving a couple of opportunities for Addressing some Premise in the sandbox <i>as long as it doesn't come at the expense of the sandbox</i>. It's actually a really nice mix.<br/><br/>The trick to doing two things at once is to decide which of the things matter the most to you and accept that the other thing is compromised. For example, putting mittens on while running down the stairs requires me to keep stair running in my mind in a way that I wouldn't have to do if I wasn't also putting mittens on. Just running down the stairs I don't have to think at all, the body just does it automatically. But also putting mittens, I have to be accepting of the fact that there's an occasional gap or fumble in the mittens-pulling-on because I sure as heckfire don't want there to be one in the stairs-down-running.<br/><br/>And I don't want there to be a compromise in the integrity of blorb.<br/><br/>So for me a super weird &amp; alien game like Fiasco, Microscope, the Skeletons\u2026 they stay so far away from blorb (no risk of falling in stairs) so I feel safe with them. A game like Sorcerer on the other hand is like "nooo you're gonna trip &amp; hurt yourself!".<br/><br/>Unless you take care and <b>move all bang-like-stuff through the "sandboxifying queue"</b> that is rolltables &amp; map keys, make them less scripted and more part of the organic world (handing responsibility of introducing them over to the gloracle)\u2014and make them something that the hobos might miss or that maybe don't happen. An example of a fail is in my beloved <i>Lost Mine of Phandelver</i> which is <i>almost</i> the perfect adventure but there is one room where someone is "juuuust about to get killed when the hobos arrive" \u2014 rereading the adventure right now, the room description looks innocuous and not "time-sensitive" (the guy is just beaten up &amp; is being interrogated) but my players somehow got the impression that the moment was "scripted" and it wasn't well received therefore. "Deep Carbon Observatory" has this problem too, which is unfair to it; the event generator system for the very first part flows SO naturally into each other, and the choices the players make are so seamlessly integrated, that it feels completely scripted and that there were never any choices in the first place, making it feel like a completely railroaded &amp; therefore crappy sequence. So those are some pitfalls you have to watch out for when working with the bane of all sandbox: "events".<br/><br/>The random rumor table is a very valuable tool to place things like this on.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484117/#Comment_484117" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-24T08:37:49+00:00" title="May 24, 2019  8:37AM">May 24</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2019 8:39AM by Rafu.">edited May 24</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Amen to that.<br/><br/>You seem to be rejecting what used to be called "vanilla narrativism" on the Forge a million years ago, and I'm fine with that. "Vanilla narr" existed as an evolutionary step, and now that we've developed games with dedicated techniques there's no need to go back to that except to satisfy one's historical curiosity.<br/><br/>And I say that as someone who's quite fond of <i>Sorcerer</i>! But I don't believe I would be able to play <i>Sorcerer</i> any effectively had I not played <i>Apocalypse World</i> before, as well as read through it, it being such a good treatise on how to MC itself (that which no <i>Sorcerer</i> edition or supplement is). And I believe I "get" <i>Apocalypse World</i> thanks to having experienced more compactly designed games before that: had I come to it exclusively from playing <i>Pathfinder</i> adventure paths, who knows what I'd have read into it!<br/><br/>To introduce RPGs to new audiences, or to introduce "story now" play to more "traditional" RPG audiences, I'll keep using tightly designed games such as <i>Follow</i>, <i>Dog Eat Dog</i>, <i>Montsegur 1244</i>, <i>SKEW</i>, <i>Lovecraftesque</i> etc., thank you, and I wouldn't dream of indulging my quirky Sorcerer habit on such occasions. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><small>Actually, I do use a lot of games with a GM role for new-to-RPG audiences too: <i>Psi*Run</i>, <i>Fables of Camelot</i>, <i>On Mighty Thews</i>...

And while conventional storygaming wisdom suggests that you should jump at these opportunities because storygaming loves conflict (and maybe also because it inherits some of trad's <i>obligation to play along</i>), perhaps in proper sandbox style the actual bang is/should be the choice to engage or not, and the consequences come from that choice.<br/><br/>I don't know how much that constitutes Real Actual Narrativism though. It feels more like in-character Microscoping almost?<br/><br/>I once saw someone describe the ideal experience of being a bottom (in the sexual sense) as "getting what you want without having to ask for it." I keep coming back to that description a lot when it comes to roleplaying games. It has been my experience that there are a lot of roleplaying bottoms who hate storygaming's/narrativism's tendency to be up front about what you want to see happen, and who cluster around variations of pseudo-sandbox or SIM play or blorby games that are curated to provide a very thin slice of experience.<br/><br/>Anyways the point there (and I apologize if this is one of those things that's so blatantly obvious that nobody ever says it and I just don't realize it) is that sandbox play might not <i>really</i> be about all the procedures and the superficial descriptions of what goes on, as much as it is about that desire to get what you want without having to ask for it. All the superficial dross of the game is just there to obfuscate the workings by which someone else acknowledges that our desires are valid, to soothe the anxiety and guilt we feel over wanting things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484122/#Comment_484122" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-24T09:49:52+00:00" title="May 24, 2019  9:49AM">May 24</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" rel="nofollow">yukamichi</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I feel like a lot of the more hardcore-sandbox-purist advice already tends to acknowledge this?

Say \u201cOK, three hours pass and then there\u2019s a knock on the door\u201d, don\u2019t wait for 3 hours at the game table irl. This sounds ridiculous to people who know how to GM without making this mistake but it\u2019s a super common mistake!! If nothing happens for 3 weeks in the game then nothing happens! Just fast-forward to when something does happen.

I was talking about the Story Now kind of preparation, but even then, you can't account for all possible places your players might try to visit, even more when running for example urban games where their options aren't constrained like a dungeon or some other natural environments.<br/><br/>But leaving that aside, I don't fully buy in those "musts" about how prep must be done. It seems a very particular style of GMing prep technique that you seem to be broadly applying to games that don't fit in. Especially since you seem to not apply it to the other games you praise, like Fiasco, where every player makes things up... all the session. I know, Fiasco is GMless, but I don't think all games with GM can be dumped into the same bag, and GMs be judged according to the same principles.<br/><br/>With some Story Games, I think the purpose of having those flags defined, is that when making something on the spot, you can tie that thing to one of those flags. For example, in AW, you need to make an NPC on the spot, so you tie them to an existing front, or to an NPC or gang/group that's tied to the PCs. You're still making sth on the spot, but your improvisation is thematically linked to the important content of the campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484156/#Comment_484156" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-24T19:07:15+00:00" title="May 24, 2019  7:07PM">May 24</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The principle I read Sandra as striving for is something like diegetic coherence, implying both internal consistency among all of the made-up things about the world and the sort of asymmetric distribution of information that makes it possible for players to feel as if they are "discovering" a pre-existing world.

Do I really want to "discover" a pre-existing world when playing a story now game? How does that mingle with, for example, one use for wises in Burning Wheel, where the player may state as part of their intent a fact about the setting, and then roll to see if it's true? Or, for example, the first session (or first 2 sometimes) in Apocalypse World or Monsterhearts, where mostly the GM will ask the players for details about the scenario in order to make the fronts. <br/><br/>So, how could those games be judged by this specific expectation for GM prep, when in their rules they explicitly go against it several times? I can probably find even more examples, like Circles in BW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ebear" title="ebear"><img alt="ebear" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ebear">ebear</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484160/#Comment_484160" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-24T19:35:17+00:00" title="May 24, 2019  7:35PM">May 24</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This isn't addressed to anyone in particular. I find it helpful to talk about what we want in our games and why certain techniques support or don't support that thing. The RISS which I think 2097 is using as a basis for a lot of this discussion definitely does get into that, particularly where it points to where certain techniques step on one another's toes.<br/><br/>But at the same time I still feel like we have a lot more words for techniques than we do for experiences. Sometimes it's hard for me to express what I want from a game because I don't know it until I see it, or even if I know what it is I have a hard time expressing it to someone else.<br/><br/>It's obviously a way more subjective thing than technique but it still seems worth talking about. Here are some phrases that have helped me to understand what folks are striving for with blorby play:<br/>"Holodeck" play &lt;- This is one I've heard 2097 use<br/>"Escape room" play &lt;- Someone else on the internet talked about it this way<br/><br/>There's a particular kind of experience that I call "playing 20 questions with a doorknob" which I really like.

For example, putting mittens on while running down the stairs requires me to keep stair running in my mind in a way that I wouldn't have to do if I wasn't also putting mittens on. Just running down the stairs I don't have to think at all, the body just does it automatically. But also putting mittens, I have to be accepting of the fact that there's an occasional gap or fumble in the mittens-pulling-on because I sure as heckfire don't want there to be one in the stairs-down-running.<br/><br/>And I don't want there to be a compromise in the integrity of blorb.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nI'm super charmed by this metaphor by the way. I can think of a specific campaign where things became more and more glove focused until I ended up in a heap at the bottom of the stairs. I had to beg my group to port our game over to a more glove focused system (read "dungeon world"). I think I've mentioned that before.<br/><br/>And it goes in the other direction too. I sometimes use blorby techniques when I play Trollbabe, but in that case the stairs are the nitfol techniques and the gloves are the blorby ones...

I run Monster of the Week which is a powered by the apocalypse game pretty regularly. I have a really hard time figuring out what the priorities of that game are. But at the same time people seem to love when I run that game. It's excruciating for me though because I can't isolate what they like about it and I don't know what my role is.<br/><br/>Also last weekend I met someone who had played some Delta Green but otherwise didn't have much rpg experience. He told me he wanted to play in an illusionist game straight up, he said he wanted a game (I'm paraphrasing) "where it feels like you have a lot of options but no matter what you choose to do you end up in the right place at the right time and it's a good story". I told him it sounded like the games that I used to run when I was first starting, I called them "dinner theater" games, he said that sounded great. It broke my heart because I don't want to do that anymore. <br/><br/>I ended running Barrowmaze for him and some folks using Knave, does that make me a bad person? I think they had a good time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite" title="AlexanderWhite"><img alt="AlexanderWhite" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite">AlexanderWhite</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484178/#Comment_484178" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-24T20:59:25+00:00" title="May 24, 2019  8:59PM">May 24</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2019 9:00PM by AlexanderWhite.">edited May 24</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> <br/><br/>To tie together what you and <a href="/forums/profile/ebear">@ebear</a>  are saying.

To be clear I'm actually coming from a place of making things less burdensome for myself. For one thing when I run a blorby game I usually don't <i>make</i> the prep myself, sometimes I do, but a lot of the time I buy it. I like reading modules, it's fun for me. So for me building a sandbox is really just a matter of picking a couple of location based modules with similar tone, adding some connections between them, plopping them down a map, and filling the spaces in between. But if I'm being honest it took me a while to get there, I don't think there are really shortcuts.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Khimus" rel="nofollow">Khimus</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>To be fair, I've had some players occasionally tell me it looked like I was improvising (like, in a bad way) for a particular session.

I'm choosing to lay it at the feet of the system saying that it should be setting expectations for me. But there's probably a way of setting those expectations myself, it's just hard.

We can have sandbox design in an entirely non-traditional game, and lots (maybe most?) games using traditional techniques are definitely NOT blorb (e.g. Silmenume's "spicy dice" game).<br/><br/>I feel very safe saying that, by Sandra's standards, <i>Sorcerer</i>, <i>Apocalypse World</i>, and <i>Dungeon World</i> are not "fully blorby" games (although all can end up featuring a lot of sandboxy GM prep).<br/><br/><b><i>Ultimately, it's really about separating the techniques</i></b> (e.g. traditional mechanics, prepared sandbox, impartial resolution, player narration) <b><i>from the creative goals of play</i></b>. Almost any combination is possible with the right design.<br/><br/>(By the way, I agree that <i>Fiasco</i> is not a particularly Narrativist-supporting game. It's probably possible to get that kind of play out of it, but it certainly isn't "built in", and rarely happens, in my experience, unless everyone at the table is hardcore gunning for that anyway. It's highly non-traditional and can create great stories, but I wouldn't call it an explicitly Narrativist game, nor categorize it that way myself.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484195/#Comment_484195" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-25T06:39:29+00:00" title="May 25, 2019  6:39AM">May 25</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p></div></blockquote> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ebear" rel="nofollow">ebear</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I ended running Barrowmaze for him and some folks using Knave, does that make me a bad person?

A small town, a couple of small dungeons, some rumours, some encounter tables. When you fall back to tier three, you pat yourself on the back, pick yourself up, keep going, and before next session you patch the hole (most often by adding mechanics or tables for this kinda thing). This is a feedback loop that lets you start simple and always keep improving.</p><p>I was playing with a group of newbies a few months ago, I just grabbed the classic \u201cHoly Sword!\u201d one page dungeon and gave them some level 5 pregens. It was gonna be boardgame night and I wasn\u2019t sure if they would be into D&amp;D so I didn\u2019t want to put too much effort in. And then whatever they tried I had a rule for it. (I play Finchian trap-finding style, but plenty of things <em>are</em> rule-driven such as I\u2019ve picked up the Veins of the Earth method of setting climbing DCs.) And they were so impressed at how they could do <em>anything</em> but yet it all had rules and felt solid. Well, because I\u2019ve been in this \u201cfeedback loop\u201d of the three tiers of truth and improving over 5 years of play.</p><p>I tried to prep an ACKS sandbox according to the rules in that book and completely bounced off it. I tried rolling up a sandbox according to <a href="https://batintheattic.blogspot.com/2009/08/how-to-make-fantasy-sandbox.html" rel="nofollow">some of the more ambitious blog posts out there</a>. Completely unpossible. (I\u2019m just too lazy &amp; too busy tripping balls &amp; posting on S-G.)</p><p>Then when the 5e starter set came out, that was perfect. One flimsy little booklet of rules and one flimsy little booklet of sandbox. I see the PHB, the MM, and the DMG as \u201cexpansions\u201d to the starter set and the starter set as the core game\u2665 I was <em>terrified</em> of DMing but man I love those flimsy booklets and those blue dice\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665</p><p>Also, I need to augment the three tiers of truth principle with the \u201cwallpaper saliency\u201d principle. It\u2019s 100% fine to improvise things that are mere color. From principles &amp; a feel of the characters and world. \u201cWhat wallpaper is it in here?\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s torn, they seem to not really care about their abode.\u201d When things become salient, then you can\u2019t improvise those things anymore. For example a spell that lets you teleport through yellow surfaces. Then suddenly you might need a \u201crandom wallpaper table\u201d!</p><p>Here\u2019s an example both of the wallpaper saliency principle and of how this \u201cfeedback loop\u201d of the three tiers of truth is <em>still</em> ongoing. It\u2019s a path leading forever towards the horizon and I\u2019m <em>still</em> growing and improving as a DM. Most recently a player wanted to know if moss grew here.

So I was already in <em>love</em> with the high agency of blorby play. So when the players (I mentioned this in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/484194/#Comment_484194" rel="nofollow">the other thread just now</a> didn\u2019t enter the \u201clevel one area\u201d, I thought that was just <em>awesome</em>.

And this metaphor became a wreck!</p><p>Our second campaign I had set up at sorta family soap opera / inheritance drama with a shop that I expected the players to get to gradually know and maybe get involved in. I had also a thief that was casing the shop that I thought the players might fight. But the first thing they did was try to rob the shop!

It\u2019s a show. I have a pretty low bar for the quality of play on a show. It would be just as dumb to try to criticize the gameplay on the old Dungeons &amp; Dragons cartoon. Matthew Mercer is a great guy. SUPER cool.<br/>I\u2019ve watched maybe 20 eps or so of Critical Role; I think I\u2019m up to like ep 16 or so of the second campaign (yes I\u2019m way behind; I just don\u2019t like to watch TV when I have mental health issues, it\u2019s not a good activity for me) and I\u2019ve seen a handful of eps of first campaign.</p><p>Their use of gloriously detailed encounter areas is obv not a good idea (see above). They don\u2019t do full OSR style sandbox play but they let the dice fall where they may &amp; develop the areas where they see the player character\u2019s going. Ryley\u2019s analysis was completely off and was dumb. If I <em>were</em> to judge it, I couldn\u2019t because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in Mercer\u2019s head or behind his screen. And, again, I don\u2019t want to scare people <em>away</em> from blorb, I want to teach them so that they can <em>reach</em> blorb.</p><p>One of my players is a big crit role fan and at first they said \u201cOh, can\u2019t you do this or this or this thing more like Mercer\u201d and I said \u201cNo, I\u2019m gonna do it my style\u201d and then now, a year later, the same player said \u201cOh, I was watching crit role and it was so annoying how they did this or this or this, I wish they did it more like you\u201d and I was like\u2026 <em>yes! vindicated!</em>\u2665</p><p>Because in the end all you need to satisfy are your own group.

The reason that potentially tautological-sounding premise works in Sorcerer is because <i>everything about the design of the game</i> pushes you further and further towards answering that question in an interesting way. From the Kickers and Bangs to the very premise of the game: that you can bend reality and summon Demons to do your bidding.<br/><br/>It's no simple or small thing; it's big and, if you follow the steps of the game's process, it really gets pumped up to 11. That's not a "low bar" at all, but quite the contrary. I could see people seeing how exaggerated and central that premise becomes in Sorcerer and assuming that anything lighter and subtler must NOT qualify as Narrativism, which would be a mistake as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484216/#Comment_484216" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-25T08:22:29+00:00" title="May 25, 2019  8:22AM">May 25</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The problem is that, by doing the prep before seeing the characters, you\u2019d be erasing/removing most of the fun that Alexander is describing.

The reason that potentially tautological-sounding premise works in Sorcerer is because <i>everything about the design of the game</i> pushes you further and further towards answering that question in an interesting way. From the Kickers and Bangs to the very premise of the game: that you can bend reality and summon Demons to do your bidding.</p><p>It\u2019s no simple or small thing; it\u2019s big and, if you follow the steps of the game\u2019s process, it really gets pumped up to 11.

Occasionally, such a twist is warranted. <br/><br/>But it's a question of practicality and repeatability:<br/><br/>What if we had four or five PCs, each with a stated goal or premise, and we failed to address all of them? Keep in mind that this means that each player came to the game hoping to deal with that issue/topic/dilemma, and not a single one was actually brought out in play. Now imagine doing that over and over and over.<br/><br/>Those aren't going to be happy players.<br/><br/>It would be like sending D&amp;D adventurers into a dungeon with no monsters, no traps, and no treasure. I can imagine an unusual, single adventure where that's the case and it's still interesting... but it's not a really a sustainable model for "what you should do when your friends say they want to play D&amp;D with you". They'll be disappointed; it was only the shock value that was making it work in the first place - working against expectations. Once those are no longer the expectations, the "trick" doesn't work anymore.<br/><br/>The D&amp;D players want to fight monsters and collect treasure. Max the thief wants there to be an orphanage, the potential for finding gold, and some scary stuff that he must decide whether to face or not.

Thanks for the advice, I guess, Sandra, but I disagree with plenty of it. I'm currently GMing BW and can't imagine how a table might improve it more than brainstorming with the BITs in mind prior to the session, for example. In fact, I don't fully accept that principle of random generated content &gt; improvised content, the whole thing seems an alien creature imposed over a game that doesn't fit into that school of GMing.<br/>I'll be GMing SwN some day, but again I don't buy that blorb somehow is the standard by which every GMed game must be judged. Seems to me like criticising D&amp;D for not supporting story now play, like we somehow devolved into "these games must ALL do/have X, Y and Z, regardless of their goals", which is a very backwards mindset.\n<blockquote>Very true! However, in a Narrativist game, the desire for blorbiness would be *very low*, so it's unlikely to be a sticking point for anyone. (More to the point, if I'm running a Narrativist game, I'm not going to set up any false expectations of blorbiness.)</blockquote>\nThanks.<br/>My experience with story now games is that they tend to be a bit weak while the scenario is being built, and pretty intense afterwards. Some players don't like those first sessions, other ones actively collaborate into it. As usual, it's not an agenda for everybody, the same way not everybody wants to play a sandbox.<br/><br/>To comment on other things written in this thread, how'd a story now game behave if the scenario was created by the GM before even the PCs were, as Sandra prefers? In Torchbearer and BitD (is BitD story now?), I've found it works mostly alright, if the dungeon in the first case is used as a half painted canvas that's completed with BIG related content.<br/>For Apocalypse World or BW? Not so much, unless even the PCs are pre generated, and the players agree to play that scenario (like a one shot, for example).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite" title="AlexanderWhite"><img alt="AlexanderWhite" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite">AlexanderWhite</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484244/#Comment_484244" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-25T16:02:23+00:00" title="May 25, 2019  4:02PM">May 25</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Khimus" rel="nofollow">Khimus</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Ok.

I make a thief charlatan. <br/><br/>I choose a few things from the charlatan TIBF list.<br/><br/>Scam: I put on new identities like clothes. <br/>(T) I lie about almost everything, even where\u2019s no good reason too. <br/>(I) I never target people who can\u2019t afford to lose a few coins. <br/>(B) A powerful person killed someone I love, someday soon I\u2019ll have my revenge. <br/>(F) I can\u2019t resists a pretty face.<br/><br/>Now that\u2019s not great for Narrativist play. We need to tweak stuff before we start. We want a kicker/inciting incident. Related to the (B) seems strongest. So we\u2019ll start by creating the powerful person and what the kicker is. We need to make it urgent, so let\u2019s say it\u2019s a Prince and I\u2019ve learnt that he\u2019s on a diplomatic mission for two weeks, somewhere close. He\u2019ll be less well guarded than when he\u2019s at his palace at home.<br/><br/>That\u2019s strong but now we need an actual personality. (T) is weak. No good reason? that\u2019s bullshit. We need to rewrite. I lie about almost everything because if people knew the real me they would use it against me (people are mostly scum).<br/><br/>That plays into the (I) in an interesting way as well. People might be mostly scum but I\u2019m not.<br/><br/>I also use my lies to get pretty people into bed with me. That says something interesting about how my character views sex and love. Oh, but my lover was killed (B), maybe he was the only person I could be honest with. <br/><br/>So that sounds like a good character. We begin play, the GM has no prep.<br/><br/>The starting situation is that I\u2019m broke and I live in a large city<br/><br/>Very first thing the GM asks: <br/><br/>GM: What do you do?<br/><br/>Player: I\u2019m going to run a confidence game on one of the nobles. I need that money and I need it quick, to get my revenge. Yet they need to be able to loose a few coin. So I\u2019m going to scout out my contacts, ask around, find someone I\u2019d be comfortable conning out of their cash.<br/><br/>GM: (notices a good opportunity for a roll) ok I\u2019ll roll your trait in secret and record the result.  (The GM rolls and it\u2019s a failure. He decides the charlatan will find someone who appears they can lose a few coin, but on deeper inspection they can\u2019t)<br/><br/>At this point the player go back and forth describing the con and all that good stuff. It takes maybe a week to set up and we get to know the various characters more. Then this happens:<br/><br/>GM as the Noble: I really hope this scheme works.

You seem to want to paint everything in terms of "good" and "bad", which makes it difficult to have these discussions, but I'd encourage you to get away from value judgements and just look at what's happening dispassionately. I'm not trying to saying anything is good or bad; just <i>to formulate a good description of what's happening</i>.<br/><br/>It seems to me that <i>Critical Role</i> is a good exemplar, because you and I are both familiar with it, it can be referenced specifically (down to particular moments of play!), and Mercer has made videos explaining what he's doing. (Not in great depth, in my opinion, but there are some clues there as to how he's running the game.)<br/><br/>You've said that "narrativism is bullshit when used with traditional techniques", and that, therefore, you only like it or accept it (?) in a game which is so obviously non-traditional that "blorb" qualities and techniques couldn't possibly be relevant (e.g. <i>Fiasco</i> is a single session game with no GM and no possibility for prep).<br/><br/>I'd like to posit that some non-zero portion of <i>Critical Role</i> (and, arguably, many of the best/most memorable/touching moments) are Narrativist, or at least look similar enough to Narrativism that we can use them as an example.<br/><br/>Clearly, I think:<br/><br/>* <i>At least some</i> bits of play are hitting a potential Narrativist payoff.<br/>* The techniques of play, as well as the mechanics, are entirely traditional.<br/>* [Slightly more debatable] The game isn't being run according to "blorb" principles (or, at least, not to Sandra standards, nor mine).<br/><br/><i>[EDIT: Replaced the character names from the below with made-up names to protect the spoiler-sensitive.]<br/></i><br/>If we accept at least the two first premises above, can we imagine a version of <i>Critical Role</i> that is entirely focused on the sort of emotional payoff that occurs in premise-heavy moments? Where those high emotional stakes moments are the thing that all the participants are trying to create and pursue? "Gundarf defeats the Evil Duke, but doesn't kill his sister, giving her freedom and forgiveness despite her betrayal of the family"... or this quote from a commenter: "Each of those moments were emotional and powerful, but...this moment was beyond words. I couldn't agree more with Colville, Frobdug's decision was the climax of the story, and I was tearing up alongside Sam" - and THAT is why everyone involved in the game is coming to the table every week. It doesn't seem like a stretch to me.<br/><br/>In that hypothetical game (I don't want to assume anything about how the players <i>actually</i> feel about their real, actual game), we would have a Narrativist agenda being pursued with entirely traditional techniques. All the participants seem to be enjoying every bit of it, as well. In what way would that be "bullshit"? Where would you see the breakdown (or potential breakdown)?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484260/#Comment_484260" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-25T20:37:45+00:00" title="May 25, 2019  8:37PM">May 25</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's worth revisiting Ron Edwards' take on this, in the essay "Setting and Emergent Stories."

Can we imagine a game that's very much *like* Critical Role, but with different people involved and, perhaps, more clarity on the Narrativist angle, and discuss that? It really isn't about the specifics of Critical Role, but about the exemplar of a game run with traditional techniques which could pursue a Narrativist agenda, which you seem to be really against but refuse to tell us why or how it could be a problem.<br/><br/>I'll edit out the spoilers, though; that's a good idea.<br/><br/>As for the Colbert video, it has nothing to do with this thread, but I'll make it easy for you - I think you'll find it interesting example for your "remapping" interest - watch from 15:00 exactly to 18:00.

Each game design (and I'm including GM tools like this in the idea of the "System" operating at the table) will make different choices and prioritize different things.<br/><br/>In Narrativism-supporting designs, in particular, the dice are often used to create opportunities for the players to pursue their characters' goals (and to prevent other players, like the GM, from simply refusing those). In AW, for instance, the design of the moves allows for a chance of success in various fictional situations that a bad GM might otherwise refuse; the effects of that on long-term play are quite dramatic.<br/><br/>I remember many years ago someone asked if it was even possible to write a Narrativist "adventure", since the story was supposed to evolve in play. (At that point in time, there was no "OSR movement", and so pretty much all the "written adventures" people we familiar with had a linear progression from one scene to the next - that was the state of the art and the industry standard.)<br/><br/>So, how would you make a Narrativist scenario, without pre-determining what the story would be?<br/><br/>No one had done that yet, so someone decided to step and produce an example. I believe it was called "Well of Souls", and it was formatted as a relationship map, with each NPC having different desires and goals. There were two important nobles who could have been responsible for a death (I think it was a death; something significant and dramatic, anyway) at the heart of the scenario.<br/><br/>The GM was instructed to follow the flow of play and see what was going on, and then react accordingly by having her NPCs act and react to developing events: "once the game starts, simply play your NPCs!"<br/><br/>Then the scenario did something really weird: <i>it didn't tell you which of the two was responsible</i>. <br/><br/>I thought this was incredibly bizarre. What's the point of writing a detailed, in-depth scenario, and then leaving out the most important piece?!? It was so jarring.<br/><br/>They then explained that, as you played, you could eventually reveal that whichever of the two was the most interesting/emotionally nuanced character was responsible for the murder.<br/><br/>This was a new and very different approach to prepping for a game I'd never encountered before. It's a very interesting technique!<br/><br/>It was quite a mind-expanding exercise to try to wrap my mind around this "heretical" approach to prepping a scenario.<br/><br/>I generally prefer to have things settled beforehand (a la blorb), but sometimes this can be just the ticket (e.g. I determine that someone is poisoning the well in the village in session 1 - maybe because a player authored that detail, and we'll figure out who did it later, in prep for session 4).<br/><br/>In any case, I would never simply write off such a tool, instead adding it to my bag of tricks: for some people, it might be just the thing they prefer. For some game designs, it may be just the thing (because it's a one shot and no one preps). For some play situations, it might be perfect. And if some people out there are having fun playing with such a tool, who am I to tell them that they're doing it wrong? That makes no sense to me. Unlike, say, railroading, I see no bad social ramifications or broken promises nor the potential to ruin the game in any way.<br/><br/>Some game designs will demand this in places, as well. Particularly in games where authorship is distributed in various ways (whether subtly or not soo subtly), it is either impossible or undesirable to prep particular material. Likewise, in other designs, the room to prep something explicitly might be *right there*, despite the other features of the game:<br/><br/>As the opposite experience, we recently played <i>Witch</i>. That game is heavily improvised and collaborative, GMless, with no 'traditional' techniques at all. However, the player of the Witch is instructed to write down the guilt or innocence of the Witch at the beginning of the story and then to seal their choice in an envelope.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the envelope is opened and we find out the truth. That, in turn, informs the endgame and the eventual fates of the characters. It's a lovely use of a "blorb" technique in one of the least "blorby" games ever written! And it works perfectly in that context; take that away and <i>Witch</i> would be a far poorer game.<br/><br/>I'm all for experimenting with such hybrids and crossovers and picking the tool you need at the right time.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" rel="nofollow">EmmatheExcrucian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I wholesale agree with Sandra about narrativism not working at all when used with traditional techniques. It makes for incoherent play. </p></div></blockquote>\nI think that playing in a Narrativist style with entirely traditional techniques can be really difficult, awkward, and can very easily produce incoherent play. You're absolutely right.<br/><br/>However, to say that it "doesnt' work at all" or never works is foolish; you'd have to conclude that Narrativist play <i>didn't exist at all until 10 or 15 years ago</i>. <br/><br/>This is a silly proposition, since people have doing it since the inception of the hobby (and the concept of Narrativism was invented to describe a kind of play they were already doing, not some hypothetical thing to try in the future).<br/><br/>More importantly, that ignores the reality of the matter, which is that there is a spectrum of techniques and application such that any game can have a mixture of traditional and non-traditional techniques; Sandra's game has Hillfolk mechanics in it, Deliverator's D&amp;D game includes story game-like 'TIBFs' and Dungeon World-derived XP mechanics, etc, etc. This conversation started in the first placebecause Sandra was explaining her disinterest or dislike for Sorcerer, due to its traditional design. That game is clearly non-traditional enough that it got labeled a "story game" when it was written by many, though! (I also dislike some overly traditional aspects of Sorcerer, but I would never say it's "bullshit" or "makes for incoherent play" when so many people have had tremendously enjoyable play with those rules (see the links I posted in the "things to read on Story Games thread"; and a bunch of us here on Story Games just played Sorcerer for the first time last year and had a great time with it.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484275/#Comment_484275" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-25T22:12:00+00:00" title="May 25, 2019 10:12PM">May 25</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 25, 2019 10:41PM by Paul_T.">edited May 25</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>They are awesome for a narrativist game.<br/><br/>That's why I'm encouraging narrativists to go blorb but if they do, to go <i>wholly</i> blorb or else they'll have incoherence.<br/><br/>If addressing the premise is your <i>NUMBER ONE GOAL</i> then you might run in into trouble if that makes you want to compromise blorb.

I don't understand how you can make all those statements in the same post. To the point of being completely lost, frankly.<br/><br/>Are Narrativism and "blorb" opposites in your mind, and mutually exclusive? <br/><br/>If so, you're asking "Narrativists" to stop playing the way they like and to switch to a different playstyle (since going "full blorb" is going to replace their primary creative goal).<br/><br/>If they are not opposites, but, instead, can support each other, then why this thread? Isn't your whole point that they are incompatible here ("bullshit", more specifically)?<br/><br/>(Or are you separating "blorb" and "traditional techniques" into completely different corners, and expecting "Narrativists" to adopt blorb but stay away from "traditional techniques"? That sounds odd, as well.)<br/><br/><br/>EDIT: Rereading your post, it makes a little more sense than it did at first. However, there is still the issue that the very definition of "Narrativist" is that "addressing premise is YOUR NUMBER ONE GOAL", and your advice to that person is make it no longer your number one goal. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I'm not sure what to do with that, nor have you explained why there might be incoherence if they do so.

How would the game be different if, in every one of those cases, you rolled, instead?<br/><br/>Consider that in the MC's choice of moves. Consider that when picking from lists for character creation.

Given that you don\u2019t need to use any dice to get a nice dramatic decision point. Why do you use dice? Why not just have the GM constantly describe outcomes that lead to the most intense and dramatic situations?</p></div></blockquote>\nYou're conflating 2 different things and making them look like they're the same. I've been mostly talking about tables and randomness to generate setting content. I think that's fine, but by no means a priority for every game. Using dice for conflict resolution is another thing, which I also like. Some narr games don't use it, but I mostly like some randomness when it comes to conflicts. The potential I see in it is that sometimes players just want their characters to solve a conflict the easiest way possible (avoiding a dilemma or hard choice, for example). Here, the dice bring the setting and genre constraints that lead to some hard choices on behalf of the player. Externalizing this to dice makes it easier for me, the GM, and less predictable. Sometimes characters will actually avoid making a hard choice and just, I don't know, start the revolution without spilling blood.<br/><br/>Regarding your example, I don't know what that "roll a trait" means in D&amp;D5th. But in my mind, your example is conflict resolution with an explicit intent stated by the player, which means I would never resolve it by rolling on a random table. In BW, I'd have him roll Circles to find a suitable noble to be conned, a roll where the player gets full use of their resources to affect the outcome, unlike a random table.<br/><br/>Imagine the player just said this, you go on and roll on a table to generate the noble, and find out he's deeply in debt. Why have you presented him an NPC that's useless to his purposes? Why don't the PC social skills factor in the noble he'll get to con? Will he have to skip that noble for you to keep rolling on that table until he finds someone suitable? For me, a Circles roll summarizes that whole process in a way where the result is relevant to the intent the player has, in a way that's connected to the PC skills rather than fully random.<br/><br/>As a side note, I'd make the roll in the open. I don't see the value in hiding a roll from the player, but that's just me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Khimus" title="Khimus"><img alt="Khimus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Khimus">Khimus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484335/#Comment_484335" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-26T16:38:43+00:00" title="May 26, 2019  4:38PM">May 26</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2019 5:43PM by Khimus.">edited May 26</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" rel="nofollow">EmmatheExcrucian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Unless I'm misunderstanding, Sandra isn't at all saying that blorb is better than everything and that games where significant facts can get decided later in play.

Or, to take it further, why every game with GM has to be blorby? Why can't players deal with a hybrid distribution of responsibilities, like they have for almost a decade or more? <br/>I'd actually root this discussion in actual play examples where these games supposedly produce incoherent play, rather than keep it in the air, because I just can't see the consequences of unblorbiness and I need concrete examples.\n<blockquote>all traditional roleplaying games should be wholly blorby.</blockquote>\nThis needs to be proved first.

The idea is that an internally consistent and causally coherent in-game universe is presented to players, who are thereby able to more easily imagine that the game-world has an independent existence. A concomitant of this is the precept that the GM is the medium through which information about the world is transmitted to players. What I hear Sandra calling for is a commitment on the part of the GM to devise information about the world in line with a scheme that privileges pre-planned info, masks the character of procedurally generated info, and deprecates the value of off-the-cuff invention. The benefit of this approach, as far as I can tell, has to do with the coherence of the fictional setting. This seems in Forge terms to be pure Right to Dream of Setting/System--where the setting and the system are really intertwined. It's an interesting approach; I wonder about the role or function of the player in it.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484338/#Comment_484338" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-26T19:02:07+00:00" title="May 26, 2019  7:02PM">May 26</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" rel="nofollow">Bill_White</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I wonder about the role or function of the player in it.</p></div></blockquote>\nStress testers, obviously <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484340/#Comment_484340" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-26T19:38:55+00:00" title="May 26, 2019  7:38PM">May 26</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill,<br/><br/>In Forge terms, a \u201cblorby\u201d approach allows the GM to act as much as possible as an objective referee, adjudicating impartially and having a clean, repeatable and unbiased process for establishing the facts of the world/adventure/environment. This means relying on objective techniques which take the GM\u2019s judgment out of those decisions. (This is, obviously to me, an impossible goal, but striving towards can make a big difference in play style.)<br/><br/>When the GM is operating in this way, it frees up the players to pursue a Step On Up agenda against the backdrop of established facts and impartial adjudication. If you make a plan to use a magic mirror to trap a demon, it works because you correctly ascertained the function of the mirror (because it was objectively determined and/or prepped), making the success of your plan based on your luck or ingenuity, not the subjective judgment of the GM. That makes for real loss and victory conditions in a way that a GM deciding which it was after the fact simply does not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484342/#Comment_484342" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-26T19:49:40+00:00" title="May 26, 2019  7:49PM">May 26</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes sense, Paul.

You already acknowledge that there are playstyles which do not involve blorb, just like there are pizzas without tomato sauce: there\u2019s no contradiction there! <br/><br/>In addition, there is or more point of difference:<br/><br/>In play with a Narrativist priority, there is no need for strict blorb. It is, by definition, not the priority. Some blorbiness can be really nice, but it doesn\u2019t make or break the game.<br/><br/>(To show otherwise, you\u2019d have to come with an example of how a failure to use blorb methods in a Narrativist game led to problems and people failing to address premise and enjoy themselves. That\u2019s what would begin to convince me there\u2019s something to talk about - until then, we\u2019re just talking about we like or dislike.)<br/><br/>There are also significant advantages to non-blorby play, which are sometimes desirable for just about any game style.

(Sandra will undoubtedly say that she "gets a charge" from seeing the gloracle in operation, but I'm quite confident that's not the actual creative payoff of the game - or, even it was for Sandra, it wouldn't be for other people using the same techniques - we've had lots and lots of conversations about that earlier and even ran a bit of a Story Games online campaign using those techniques. In theory, "blorb" can be used as a technique in any mode of play, but, in practice, it's most often used to facilitate a Step On Up agenda, which is why it needs to be adhered to *strictly* - as you can imagine, given a different creative agenda, there wouldn't likely be any need for it to be so strict.)<br/><br/>I can <i>imagine</i> a group purely enjoying the "gloracular Machine in operation" as their main creative goal, but I doubt very many people do. Sandra's game uses D&amp;D adventure modules, for example, as a large component of play - it wouldn't make much sense to do that in a game which is purely interested in Exploration of that sort, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484350/#Comment_484350" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-26T20:26:32+00:00" title="May 26, 2019  8:26PM">May 26</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" rel="nofollow">Bill_White</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>That makes sense, Paul.

Sandra mentioned earlier that she does, and I think my own preferences overlap quite a lot with a kind of pure respect for blorb, particularly in games where the gloracle is an unwieldy, caterwauling behemoth constantly threatening to careen off a cliff.<br/><br/>There's a certain subset of rules lawyers and min-maxers (I think) who aren't really looking to game the setting <i>in order to win</i>, or at least for whom Stepping On Up is secondary to simply plunging into the depths of the system to see just how far it can go (for example, it's unlikely you will ever use a Great Cleave "teleport" to actually circumvent a challenge; it's just fun to imagine the wave of gore that follows in your wake as you break the sound barrier). These players are more like Johnnys in Magic the Gathering parlance, who use the game as a vehicle of "creative expression." It's just that most games that have a lot of support for this <i>also</i> happen to be firmly Step On Up. I suspect a lot of people who prefer GMing these sorts of games also have a lot of overlap with this profile.<br/><br/>I've personally taken to calling this style of play Mousetrapping, after the Milton Bradley boardgame where watching the game's Rube Goldberg device namesake in action is by almost any measure far more interesting than actually "playing" the game. It's not exactly the same as pure, unsullied blorb-love but it heavily relies on the precepts of blorb.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ebear" title="ebear"><img alt="ebear" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ebear">ebear</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484354/#Comment_484354" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-26T20:55:53+00:00" title="May 26, 2019  8:55PM">May 26</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So <a href="/forums/profile/Khimus">@Khimus</a> I've got an actual play example from when I was running a one shot of Monster of the Week for strangers at the mall yesterday. I realize I already complained about MotW in this thread, but I think the situation I'm describing could have come up in an Apocalypse World game as well. I'm not a master class GM so there might be other issues going on here (and I'm totally interested in suggestions), but I felt like there were some competing expectations that came from having "harm" as part of the system. If it feels nitpicky and weird I'm sorry.<br/><br/>One of my guiding principles when I run anything non-blorby (which is pretty frequent) actually comes from the introduction of Dogs in the Vineyard: <blockquote>[...] if you're the GM, feel free to tell the players things their character's can't know. "You cut out across the field towards the smoldering wagon. There's a gang of robbers hiding in the grass and behind a couple of nearby trees. You haven't seen them yet. What do you do?"</blockquote> That was a big deal for me when I first read it, and I use it a lot when running Trollbabe even though examples in that text explicitly contradict it. Without it I feel like players decisions for there characters have less impact because I have too much power to effect the stakes after they've already made a decision.<br/><br/>Ok here's the background for the example: The monster hunters are at a teenage dance party in the woods where they have just started playing a CD that turns anyone who listens to it into a demon possessed serial killer. Kai (a PC who is half fae) and her cousin Erris (NPC who is fully fae) run up through the crowd to the stage just as everyone is turning into psycho killers. Kai gets caught up in a fight before she gets to the stage but Erris actually makes it up onto the stage and grabs the disk. Just as she gets the disk though, Joel (her boyfriend now possessed by demon music) grabs her and is about to stab her with a knife so she throws the disk to Kai (the actual PC) who runs to try and catch it. Across the field Earnest (another PC who is Erris' ex lover) levels his gun and tries to shoot Joel before he can stab Erris.<br/><br/>Ok here's the part that got a little weird: So I had set up this Joel is about to stab Erris situation which I guess was a soft move. The PC Earnest wants to shoot Joel both because he's trying to save Erris and also because he really hates Joel. I decide this sounds more like Act Under Pressure rather than Kick Some Ass. Earnest get's a 7-9 result which means "the Keeper is going to give you a worse outcome, a hard choice, or price to pay." I tell Earnest's player that if he shoots he will hit Joel but the bullet is going to hit Erris too. We can argue about whether that was a good "price to pay" or not but it's what I chose. Earnest decides to pull the trigger, there's a bang, and Joel and Erris fall off the stage.<br/> <br/>Now the problem: The phrase "the bullet is going to hit Erris too" feels like it should have an established meaning in the game because we have this harm system, but as Earnest is walking over to Erris I still have no idea whether she's A. basically fine (she's fae after all) B. in dangerous condition C. dead. I know I can't pick C. because part of Joel's declared intent was to save her. But about the other two? Monster of the Week just tells me pick whichever one sounds better (bottom of pg. 213). <b>I'm not saying there's anything wrong with making the decision on those terms, but it also means I should have made that decision earlier and told Earnest's player what the stakes were before he pulled the trigger.</b> And maybe that's where this example ends since I've clearly identified my mistake. But at the same I'm just wondering if the system could have helped me more here. For the record I picked B. which in retrospect feels like both the worst narrative decision (Erris is probably already mad at Earnest for shooting her even if she's more or less uninjured, and that's a more interesting consequence to me) and also the most like I'm playing "gotcha" with the players. It was the end of a very long session with no breaks so we all just went and got dinner after that. Earnest's player didn't complain to me about the outcome exactly but he seemed pretty dissatisfied (I was too).<br/><br/>But also Monster of the Week is basically a straw doll in this regard. The equivalent passage in Apocalypse World is much more interesting (honestly it has reignited my love for AW as a system) but still seems like it has an issue for me. Here's the description of what happens when an NPC takes 2-harm:\n<blockquote>wounds, bad pain, broken bones, shock. <b>Likely</b> fatal, <b>Occasionally</b> immediately fatal.</blockquote> (bolding is my emphasis)<br/>The above is followed by:\n<blockquote>If you don't like deciding arbitrarily, you can roll for it. Consider all the probability words above in d6 terms, trying to roll high: "generally" and "likely" mean on a 2-6; [...] But I think you can decide just fine for yourself if you want to.</blockquote>\nI honestly think that's awesome in some ways, but I also think it still points to the issue <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> is highlighting. If the player has no gaurantee as to whether the GM will incorporate the gloracle into the decision or not then the gloracle loses all it's magic for setting expectations and seems kind of incoherent. I feel like the gloracle could make Earnest's decision to shoot or not shoot Erris a lot more interesting, but only if it's incorporated correctly.<br/><br/>I actually still have a lot of hope for all of the above though and I'm really interested to hear people's thoughts on this. <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> seems to be suggesting that the gloracle and prep should be used for everything but the "wallpaper" as the solution, and I think that works. But I wonder if we were explicit about which outcomes were under the domain of the gloracle and which weren't if we could capture some of the gloracle/blorby magic while still leaving wiggle room in other places. This got pretty long winded so sorry about that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484356/#Comment_484356" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-26T21:44:49+00:00" title="May 26, 2019  9:44PM">May 26</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2019 9:45PM by 2097.">edited May 26</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Khimus" rel="nofollow">Khimus</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>all traditional roleplaying games should be wholly blorby.</p></div></blockquote>This needs to be proved first.

And also that\u2019s REALLY bad form of you pushing me so hard on this topic. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23emo2097&amp;Mode=like">#emo2097</a> Unlike you, my real name\u2013Sandra Snan\u2013is out here on Story Games. If someone misunderstands me as not liking this beloved-by-millions TV show\u2026 I don\u2019t want that to happen. I think a lot of things about the show is great. And Mercer is an absolute sweetheart who I really admire in many ways.</p><p>The things I personally like the most about them and that as far as I understand most fans &amp; participants like the most of them, judging from how they get selected and put into \u201cbest of\u201d-clips and similar, are either things that <em>are</em> wholly blorby [moments when the events are extremely emergent rather than pre-planned], or wholly orthogonal to blorb. There\u2019s nothing unblorby about the characters and their interactions.</p><p>The things that I don\u2019t like, and the Colbert episode (like the Vin Diesel episode before it) has a clearer example of this than anything I\u2019ve seen on the CR show proper, is when I suspect that there is unblorbiness going on behind the scenes; when I suspect illusiory techniques. Spoiler warning for the Colbert episode: the way it ended seemed very \u201cpaced as a story\u201d and not emergent, which <strong>if true</strong>, is to me not taking advantage of the medium of a roleplaying game.</p><p>So some <em>important</em> caveats to that.</p><ol><li>That ending <em>could</em> happen. I don\u2019t know or care about how Mercer runs his games. Unless you practice radical transparency of method, it\u2019s hard to see to what extent <em>any</em> given game complies with the blorbiness decree. Blorb happens at the engine level, not on the surface level.</li><li>\u201cMedium of roleplaying game\u201d; but that Colbert TV show <em>is</em> also a show. It has to comply with the expectations of two mediums at once; possibly compromising one or both of them. (That doesn\u2019t mean I think compromising blorb is heartwarming.)</li><li><strong>I don\u2019t want to gatekeep specific GMs</strong> as saying \u201cyou\u2019re doing it wrong\u201d; I want to <strong>teach blorb</strong> because I believe it can <em>improve</em> their games, not because I want to lord it over them, be smug over them, say that they\u2019re bad or w/e. I learned this lesson in the worst way during TitansGrave.</li><li>Advice shows! When someone like Mick Ryley or Matt Colville puts himself up as <em>the</em> DM teacher number one and teaches pure &amp; evil anti-blorb, that\u2019s something I <em>do</em> take issue with. Mercer\u2019s own advice show, that I didn\u2019t watch a lot of, seemed very humble and polite and vague by comparison.</li></ol><p>Back in the Critical Role thread, <strong>I</strong> was the one who was all gung-ho and \u201cLeave Britney alone!\u201d when several posters here were criticizing the show in a very patronizing way.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484357/#Comment_484357" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-26T21:44:59+00:00" title="May 26, 2019  9:44PM">May 26</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>There is no need for blorb to \u201cdie\u201d!

For instance, you could have just asked your players, set up a clock for the threat of Erris' death, or whatever else is given as an option.<br/><br/>Have you talked to the player to get to know how he felt? I don't see the game situation as something so terrible. It's certainly possible for a bullet shot at a fight, to harm an unintended target.

What I read here is the players were unclear on what the principles of this style of gaming were. They didn't want blorbiness or consistency, they wanted the illusion not to be torn apart. I've found this in other games, and many players are ok even with illusionist techniques, as long as the illusion remains. Keeping an illusion is worth that much of an effort? Definitely not for me.

I don't think I've ever told Sandra that her "real love" is challenge (it's very clear that the blorb dollhouse/gloracle is foremost in your heart!), or that her group plays with a Step On Up agenda (if I have, let me know, and I'll gladly take it back as well as apologize). Like Eero, I don't see any hope or benefit in labeling strangers online with some vague theory terms (unless they ask for it, I suppose, but no one's really ever asked me to do so). It's foolish, disrespectful, and far too likely to be entirely wrong.<br/><br/>Eero and I have both found a really successful mode of play which combines "blorb" (Sandra's term) or "hygienic GMing" (Eero's term) with a strong Step On Up agenda for really effective and highly focused gaming. I find that, once you get those concepts lined up (and learn to stick to them), it's almost bulletproof. Those ideas have allowed me to enjoy D&amp;D without reservation for the first time.<br/><br/>Unlike Sandra (but perhaps like Eero), I find both to be absolutely necessary to make it work. I played with strict "blorb" for years and years and never had that kind of gaming until the missing piece - the focus on challenge, and a recognition that it was happening even when it might seem like it's not (more about that below) - was brought in, thanks to Eero.<br/><br/>It does require a slightly more sophisticated understanding of "challenge", though (at least, enough that I could see it tripping some people up). Given that understanding, "blorb" tells us HOW to prepare material and make rules and rulings, while "focus on challenge" tells us WHEN to use it (how to distinguish wallpaper from things that are important to prep). Put the two together, and you have a working method for play that really, really works. Have just one, and you're lucky if the thing goes at all.<br/><br/>The key that's kind of weird (or, at least, easy to miss) is that the GM, in this style of play, isn't engaged in the process the same way that the players are. The GM's role is to prep and make rulings and present vivid and concrete fiction; the whole point of blorb/hygienic practices is to remove the GM from the challenge/competition. (We want to remove the GM's ability to switch what the mirror does at the last minute precisely so that she cannot invalidate the cleverness of the players by switching up what's behind the curtain - and, similarly, so she cannot cheat around a poor decision by the players by changing things in their favour.)<br/><br/>As you can see, this has absolutely nothing to do with "game balance" (there are types of games that have similar techniques and a similar agenda which find game balance important, but this is a very different beast); it has do with <i>fairness</i>. <br/><br/>It can be really fun and really exciting for the players to go up against an overwhelmingly difficult challenge. It can be really fun and really exciting when the players manage to cleverly circumvent a challenge and get an easy victory: the point is not to provide balance, but to <i>make their decisions really matter</i>. That's one of the central functions of a sandbox setup: to let the players decide which challenges they want to confront.<br/><br/>When you play in this style, the GM sets up the "dollhouse" and the rules by which it functions, and then sits back to see what will happen. The players, meanwhile, rub their hands together, feeling confident that the GM isn't cheating, and get ready to be as clever and as lucky as possible: they are facing challenge, not the GM.<br/><br/>I think that it's easy to lose sight of this as a GM committed to "gloracular" methods, because you're not really engaged in the "challenge" aspect as a participant. However, if you imagine a day when you come to the table and the players aren't trying to survive and win - perhaps they put down their weapons and run into the dungeon with their eyes closed - and you'll see that they are very much engaging with challenge, because when they stop doing so, the whole purpose for play seems really unclear all of a sudden. <br/><br/>I don't know for sure what's happening in Sandra's game, of course (and we know there's quite a mish-mash of techniques, so there's likely, I think, a mish-mash of types of "fun" happening), but that's what I've seen pretty consistently in other games I've run and played.<br/><br/>Here are some examples of why this might be true for Sandra (she'll have to confirm or deny, but I'll show what I'm seeing):\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>&lt;&lt;p&gt;Really good example.</p><p>We had a very similar example in our game yesterday. A beloved hench NPC \u2013 or rather, the wife of one of the characters, rolled up on XGE life paths\u2013(well, she\u2019s not universally loved on the soap opera layer but they need her magic cello because it conjures a cabin for them to live and she also can conjure food and water for them with it, so they def don\u2019t want her to die) had her head stuck in a trap. The way the players dealt damage to the trap also risked her. She ended up making it out with only six hit points remaining.</p><p>The fact that this was handled gloracularly added a lot to the tension and to the outcome. Yet another triumph of blorb\u2665</p></div></blockquote>\nMy impression (and you can tell me if I'm wrong) is that the players weren't approaching the wife with her head stuck in a trap with a scientist's perspective ("Hey, I guess she could live or she could die. Let's engage this mechanical process, and we'll find out which in the end, but we'll be happy either way..." - "Oh! She'd be more likely to survive if we hit the trap with a hammer, becaus she has resistance to bludgeoning weapons..." "Shut up, Bob! You're ruining the experiment! Let's stick with the spears...") but as people desperately trying to save her life (looking for new solutions, different ideas, different ways that they could get her out alive).<br/><br/>In the end, knowing that you all followed the procedures faithfully makes the success feel more earned and more real - that makes it more valuable and more potent. But the key to it is that there was a challenge and the players managed to win (this time)! They saved her!

I know that it's not the only thing that happens in Sandra's games, but it seems to be, at least, one of the main features of play.<br/><br/>The "monster AI" for combat is another example: it enables the GM to remove herself from the flow of combat, giving the players a "system" of opposition to test their skills against. (If true simulation, a la Threefold, was, instead, the goal, then giving the monsters an "algorithm" but not the PCs would be a rather unbalanced simulation. The PCs have a strong advantage in this scenario; if the idea was to "simulate" or "test" the *characters'* battle effectiveness against certain monsters, it would make sense to write a similar algorithm/AI for the PCs, as well. The fact that this isn't even remotely on the table, is, again, a way to give an opportunity to the players to Step On Up and test their wits and skills against an objective reality/system.)<br/><br/>In "what did you play this week", Sandra talks about a particularly exciting, successful heist the players pulled off:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/483939/#Comment_483939" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/483939/#Comment_483939</a><br/><br/>This seems to me as another example of how cleverness and luck win out over adversity; what makes it cool is that the players were <i>smart</i>. They faced a challenge and they <i>won</i>. <br/><br/>Read that snippet (it describes a really awesome successful heist moment!), and tell me that it's celebrating anything other than a brilliant play by the players when faced with a challenge. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Which, on a related topic, if the game isn't about challenge at least at some level, why use D&amp;D adventure modules? Why play Finchian trap-disarming games? (Heck, why have deadly traps in the first place?) Why remove all the skills from the game that replace player cleverness? Etc.<br/><br/>I hope that makes my position clear. I could be utterly wrong about Sandra and her game, for all I know, but it's definitely a trend I've seen in different groups and different situations, and it explains a lot of those questions very cleanly and efficiently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484385/#Comment_484385" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-27T03:51:09+00:00" title="May 27, 2019  3:51AM">May 27</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread is moving a bit fast for me to completely follow, so consider this a parenthetical aside.<br/><br/><small>Context: <a href="/forums/profile/Khimus">@Khimus</a> says "hey note the Disclaim Decision Making principle", <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> replies "a.k.a. consult the gloracle."<br/><br/>Either I've misunderstood the gloracle a bit, or I don't really think these are always equivalent!<br/><br/>Another, rather non-gloracular way of disclaiming decision making is Burning Wheel style stakes-setting.

I'd say yes, but what's the big deal ?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484392/#Comment_484392" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-27T07:50:44+00:00" title="May 27, 2019  7:50AM">May 27</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I'd say yes, but what's the big deal ?</p></div></blockquote>\nAgreed!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484395/#Comment_484395" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-27T08:28:16+00:00" title="May 27, 2019  8:28AM">May 27</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Next step is : when is it okay to sort of railroad players.

It's teetering on the borderline; either a brilliant design or it falls down into the ravine of sorrow.</div></blockquote>\nWhat's your reasoning for calling this mechanic in AW kind of subjective? You know, there seem to be plenty of subjective gaps in starts without number and other dust too, many of them even recognised by the author. For once, the adventure generator works with abstract concept, like "person, place, complication", which the GM then puts in context. <br/><br/>Even this blorb machine, at best, is a machine with a human operating it, pressing the levers, feeding it input and interpreting the output. Like every other game. Even this fairness is kind of an illusion. A productive one, perhaps, but it's kind of delusional to think the whole machine is less subjective than "disclaim decision making" in AW.<br/><br/>Next question: has this method been used successfully for genres other than dungeon crawling? Dungeons are kind of easy because they're a constrained space with relatively few agents, but how do you leave everything to prep and tables in a city? Even SwN admits many, many times players will have you improvise. I can imagine tons of situations that will require more "subjectiveness" than AW's  "disclaim decision making", unless the GM actually creates every building and NPC and faction in every single location, which is kind of straining even for low populations of 10k.<br/><br/>At last: in one of your recent posts, you make a point that the challenge, or game, is about survival. That's so damn specific as a goal to play! I don't think a technique that narrows the play focus so much can be thought of as a must for every game with a GM, unless most of the campaigns, games and genres start looking like a reskin of of&amp;d modules!<br/><br/>What worries me here is that there's this segment of the hobby suddenly talking about fairness, about an impartial GM and about removing subjectivity from the act of GMing, like those things exist, all while they're blind to the MANY moments of subjectivity their gaming involves!<br/><br/>One last point: it could be argued that, as well as there is tension between traditional techniques and story now mechanics, there's tension also between this pretension for objectivity and fairness, and the need of a human interpreter/operator for this blorby machine. The disruptive tension seems lower, in my opinion, for traditional story games, which kind of acknowledge the human component in the activity (it's not a computer simulation, after all, but a social game), and design with this in mind. The blorby spectrum seems to try to overcompensate by loading with work a single person. As I said before, this amount of work just to keep the illusion living is not what I aim for in an RPG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484413/#Comment_484413" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-27T13:05:12+00:00" title="May 27, 2019  1:05PM">May 27</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Khimus" rel="nofollow">Khimus</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>What\u2019s your reasoning for calling this mechanic in AW kind of subjective?

Example: If the system we use is that the player has to use their wits to disarm the trap by describing things they do and the GM adjudicating, then that\u2019s going to shape the players excitement about the situation.<br/><br/>So the way I see salience is, it\u2019s a situation we\u2019re all excited about.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484451/#Comment_484451" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-27T17:08:23+00:00" title="May 27, 2019  5:08PM">May 27</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Salience: Do you <i>need</i> to know it?<br/>Wallpaper: Would it just be cool to know it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484452/#Comment_484452" name="Item_149" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-27T17:09:14+00:00" title="May 27, 2019  5:09PM">May 27</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Absolutely! <br/><br/>So, now, how do you know before it happens whether the situation will be something you\u2019re all excited about or not?<br/><br/>Is it pure trial and error, or do you have a good sense of that before you sit down and play?<br/><br/>That understanding is required for any kind of good gaming, and, in particular, it is just as necessary in order to know what to blorb and what not to blorb. <br/><br/>Basically, a sense of what the game is about: once that\u2019s in place, we can make intelligent decisions about whether something needs to be handled a certain way or not. (This is why in Sandra\u2019s game the monsters get an algorithm but the heroes don\u2019t - because the players are here to test their skills and wits and try to win the fight, but the GM is not.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484454/#Comment_484454" name="Item_150" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-27T17:30:29+00:00" title="May 27, 2019  5:30PM">May 27</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Situation?

I'd say PCs actions are important because they reflect players decisions, which are important in any healthy game. <br/>So, that was just a bump. Paul_T's question before that was about the "situation". By that I think he meant "moment to moment". That is : when do you feel in your games that "yummy" feeling that "this (diegetic) thing is (going to be) cool" ?

That is valuable.</blockquote>\n- I can only argue by experience.  The game I play in does the exact same thing to our human players except many times the game is 100% non-blorb.  We will sit down, the GM will ask us to read off our characters and in less than 30 minutes were off and running and totally transported to another world.  I am utterly delighted at the success of your GMing and design efforts but I can't think of a game that is more diametrically opposed to blorby play than ours is from yours.  This isn't good or bad.  Just a <i>completely</i> different approach to the process of play.  Just one example - You push for absolute clarity of play (am I using the correct phrase?) while we embrace the fog of war.<br/><br/>Just my 2 cents.

The focus in your game (Sandra) is, it seems to me, to create something as "tangible" as possible that the players can then interact with. There are solid and predictable qualities and quantities and solid and reliable ways to interact with them. We know that there's something inside the treasure chest, and that, if we open it, Sandra won't change what it is on us. We know that the monsters will attack according to an algorithm. We know how much we can carry. And so on.<br/><br/>Jay/Cary's game is all about the experience of the world/story/characters, and uses obfuscation on every level to achieve that.<br/><br/>You want things to *be* as real and tangible as possible, and for player decisions to matter as much as possible. This demands transparency of method.<br/><br/>Cary wants things to *feel* as powerful as possible, and for the players' emotional experience to be immersive and memorable. This demands "fog of war", so that you can feel the tension and fear and uncertainty and experience it vicariously.<br/><br/>Complete opposites, in my opinion. I would engage in each of your games in a completely different way, and being a good player in them demands very different skills, approach, and mindset.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484525/#Comment_484525" name="Item_165" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-28T19:50:09+00:00" title="May 28, 2019  7:50PM">May 28</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Also, I'm not sure why the "fighting algorithm" went so far over your head.

I was saying that this thought experiment - imagining either of those things, and seeing how undesirable either of them is - reveals a lot about your play priorities.)<br/><br/>(For instance, if you started to think that "Threefold Simulationism" was your actual goal, you'd have to conclude that writing an algorithm for the PCs would be at least worth considering - it would play nicely into the "simulation", and give a better "answer", rather than giving one side a dramatic advantage over the other. And if your goal was an adversarial competition between the two sides, you'd want to take away the monsters' algorithm, because it handicaps one side. On the other hand, if your goal was to create a railroady story, you might want an algorithm for the PC side, and then to be able to improvise the monsters' actions, so as to steer the fight's outcome to your desired ends.)<br/><br/>(But your solution, instead, suits your game perfectly: and that's because it enables precisely what you want - for the GM to act as impartial referee, while a clear and definite, "real", tangible process gives the players something to test their wits and skills against.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" title="Silmenume"><img alt="Silmenume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">Silmenume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484529/#Comment_484529" name="Item_166" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-28T20:17:36+00:00" title="May 28, 2019  8:17PM">May 28</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 29, 2019 4:55AM by Silmenume.">edited May 29</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Sandra,\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>To clarify, Silmenume, blorb isn\u2019t about clarity [even though you\u2019re right that I <em>loooove</em> clarity], blorb is about the game world being consistent and \u201creal\u201d and the DM not changing things around behind the scenes, instead sticking to the truth of \u201cwhat\u2019s really there\u201d. </p></div></blockquote>\nFirst my apologies for mis-identifying what "blorb" meant.  Adding confusion serves no one's interests in forum discussions.  Mea culpa.<br/><br/>Here's the rub with "what's really <i>there</i>."  There is no ontological "there" there.  It's <i>all</i> an artificial construct manufactured by human beings.  As far as role-playing games are concerned (the act of Exploration as defined by Setting, Character, Situation, Color and System) the only "reality" that matters is the SIS.  Which is also an artificial construct.  The primacy of the SIS is so vital because it covers the idea of <i>all</i> the players interacting with it with agency as mediated by System.  This is the uniqueness of RPGs as compared to other recreational pastimes.  It is a group imagination process...a highly ritualized form of conversation if you will.<br/><br/>We use physical props to influence this conversation but they are no more "truth" than the SIS.  This includes having pre-written notes on "what's really there".  Until these things enter the SIS directly in themselves (physical things) or affect the physical things (a pile of enriched Uranium that is causing radiation sickness in people but is itself not [yet] established) then they are merely potentialities under the control of the GM.<br/><br/>I'm not arguing against game prep as a useful process.  I'm just arguing that it is merely a technique to help with the player who is functioning in the role of "GM".  If this technique helps the person of "GM" facilitate their players to "immerse" into the artificially constructed world then bully for the GM!  Good for that person for finding a method of GMing that works for them.  However that <i>technique of prep</i> does not represent "truth" any more than a game where the GM does no pre-game prep.  As far as the SIS is concerned there is no difference.  The only thing that matters are the words spoken by the GM.  It is only then that when those words are accepted as credible via the Lumpley Principle do they <i>matter</i>.<br/><br/>Now we get into issues of player protagonization WRT to CA's.  There is a form of deprotagonizaton that crosses all CA's (when a player is shut out from entering anything into the SIS) but there is also CA specific player deprotagonization.  Paul Czege argued this WRT how this worked in Narratist play which is <i>very different</i> with how player deprotagonization functions in Gamist play.  I was going to post a link to the thread but the Forge Archives seem to be down.<br/><br/>I'm seeing two basic thrusts to your arguments.<br/><br/>First is a matter of trust among the players and the GM.  Blorb preparation deals with this by not dealing with said trust but by player verification of GM pre-game notes.  There are other ways of handling this including but not limited to game design, System and being consistently straight with one's players.  I gave you the example of the Elf running on water for the latter.<br/><br/>Second the magic of the Gloricle (which I believe is a description of "blorby" play) leads to player "immersion."  Great!  That is a <i>Technique</i> you employ to help facilitate getting your players to a state of being - that of "immersion".  That's a hard thing to do in general and that you manage to achieve it regularly is to be commended.  But <i>it isn't the only way</i> to facilitate the same effect in the one's players.  I know this to be true because of the game I play in.  I currently don't fully understand how it all works, but I've been afforded some theoretical assistance via Myth and Bricolage.  I'm not implying this other method is better, I'm just stating that it does exist and it too works very well at facilitating player "immersion".<br/><br/>I'll address your other points in a follow up post.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484530/#Comment_484530" name="Item_167" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-28T20:19:26+00:00" title="May 28, 2019  8:19PM">May 28</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The focus in your game (Sandra) is, it seems to me, to create something as \u201ctangible\u201d as possible that the players can then interact with.</p></div></blockquote><p>Ain\u2019t disputing that but I was replying to some specifics in the post such as the clarity-vs-fog-of-war question being A. orthogonal to the blorb question, and B. not that effective in its stated goal: get players engage to engage with real-world-logic.

The "tangible" play here is exactly what I have focused my Torchbearer GM-ing on, and I think it's something the game does really well by making time, light, inventory, etc into completely player-facing currencies.  I also play with transparent obstacles (the difficulty rating of each roll).  Players can look to the back of the book and tell me the difficulty of brewing a certain elixir, or a vertical ascent with two climbers (I get to add +1 ob for extenuating circumstances, or grant them an extra die for an advantage, but that's the extent of my GM influence).<br/><br/>I think the few of my friends that didn't take to the system either said that it was too complicated or it wasn't immersive.  I don't actually think Torchbearer is more complicated than other dungeon crawling games, but far more of the rules are player-facing.  This thread has helped me see why some folks had a problem with immersion.  Every time I explained a new system, I was supporting my agenda of a transparent, tangible game but undermining their desire for a bit of "fog of war".<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484589/#Comment_484589" name="Item_173" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-29T12:42:54+00:00" title="May 29, 2019 12:42PM">May 29</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good insight!

I was expecting something... stronger... from the opening line ("Narrativism with traditional techniques is bullshit!"), though. Like some kind of fundamental incompatibility or some theoretical problem.<br/><br/>I also agree that traditional techniques are not ideal for Narrativist play; but overlooking the dozens of published games and the decades of experience people have had playing in that style would be very strange - Narrativist play with traditional techniques is all there was for people for most of the lifespan of roleplaying games.

And it's one reason to use "blorb prep" or traditional techniques, or both, for some people, in their Narrativist endeavours. But that's a very personal thing; for some people "blorbiness" helps with "feeling like you're there", for others it's that but also trust in the GM, for others still it's just about emotional connection to the story, and for some it's familiar mechanics that they don't need to spend any brain power parsing.<br/><br/>I also like some aspects of "blorb" for this reason; but I don't *need* it at all to "feel like I'm there", as I've discovered after playing a variety of games. (Though the trust in the game, the process, and the people is really key; and that's where it might come into play for you and me. Not everyone needs that, though, particularly if they've never had bad GM experiences, for instance.)\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/></p><p>It\u2019s rather that character life&amp;death is salient.

You really don't see how "character life &amp; death" and "character quest success" are issues of challenge? All those are challenges for the players to confront and try to win.<br/><br/>Have you ever played in a game where someone wanted to play a martyr, and wanted a glorious death? Or to see their character fall into a deep depression and commit suicide? Or tell the story of a man pursuing a "quest" for all the wrong reasons, failing, and learning something about himself in the process?<br/><br/>There are lots of games and playstyles where those issues aren't on the table at all.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>I don\u2019t see how \u201cblorby prep\u201d is as necessary in Narrativist play (and have yet to see an example to demonstrate why it would be harmful) as it is in this kind of game;</p></div></blockquote><p>Maybe you\u2019ve missed posts?

I thought about writing about it, but I thought I'd come off as even more annoying to you.<br/><br/>You see, I think that example actually strengthens my argument here, rather than being a counterpoint.<br/><br/>What I'm looking for is an example of Narrativist play with traditional mechanics, right? And how not using "hygienic" practices (I'm getting really tired of using "blorb" in sentences, I think I much prefer "hygienic" and "gloracle" or "principled prep") ruined the Narrativism.<br/><br/>In this case, we have a game which is not very traditional (anyone who's read Lady Blackbird can attest to that, I think) and isn't supposed to be run in a traditional way (it specifically tells you not to plan ahead, and asking the players questions to establish the fictional situation should clue players in to its improvisational nature right away).<br/><br/>Furthermore, there's absolutely no reason I can see to assume (from that writeup) that there was any Narrativism happening.<br/><br/>What I see is players engaging in what they thought was challenge-based play, and being disappointed when it turned out that it wasn't. This could be read as a failure of non-blorbiness in challenge-based play, perhaps, but not as a failure to produce Narrativism.<br/><br/>(I say "perhaps" because the players in this case were rather deluded, I think; coming up with the "steam dragon" solution is actually far more clever and interesting if it was their original idea than if it had been a "GM's plan". Their <i>real</i> disappointment was not that they didn't get to face a proper challenge and win... it was in their own misguided belief that the GM was controlling the whole experience and had planned it all out. In other words, it's not that their premise-addressing or challenge-overcoming was invalidated - again, coming up with that solution is just as clever and just as successful whether the GM improvised the dragon or not, so long as the GM didn't come up with the steam breath thing *in response* to their being out of coal - but that they were disappointed to discover Tod <i>hadn't</i> rigged it all from the start.)<br/><br/>(Perhaps a better way to say it: they thought that "figure out Tod's secret plan" was the challenge here, and they were disappointed to discover that it was "figure out something that works on your own", instead. Personally, I would have been excited by that, rather than disappointed - it would mean that it was genuinely my original idea and a clever solution to the diegetic problem.)<br/><br/>(None of that has anything to do with traditional vs. non-traditional mechanics or Narrativism at all - not that I can see, anyway.)\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Using GURPS.</p></div></blockquote>\nHa!

Ideally your game have or would have similar knowledge; like how you know that daggers &amp; arrows do PBP damage in your game. It wouldn\u2019t be great if you didn\u2019t know that, right? All of a sudden an arrow kills you and you were like \u201cwait what? I had like 50 stamina left.\u201d</blockquote>\nSee, this is interesting.  The reason for the very existence of this particular mechanic is very different from task resolution mechanics typically employed in Gamist facilitating games.  The DM didn't create this mechanic (dagger &amp; arrows bypassing stamina and doing straight PBP) so as to present the players with a ex-diegetic tactical option.  He created this mechanic so that the players of high level characters never stop fearing (read - experiencing) for their lives in combat - even against your bog standard issue, Mark I, first level Orc.  IOW that mechanic wasn't designed to clarify to the player what can and cannot be done but rather to instill a sense of <i>player fear</i>.<br/><br/>Also note in your example of the surprised player at the implied sudden <i>change</i> of the fabric of reality of the fictional world.  The presumption presented was that arrows doing direct PBP was never heretofore encountered.  That was never the case.  If the GM were to suddenly make a sudden hard break from the bricoled reality of the world there would be a riot at the table - that would be a form of CA specific player deprotagonization.  Part of the Process of play in this CA is the player figuring out how the world works and that can only happen if the <i>presented</i> reality (read - the actions demonstrated within the SIS) is consistent.  IOW - we don't need to have ex-diegetic mechanics to tell us that arrows are deadly when 40 years of gaming always had arrows act with the same lethal effect.\n<blockquote>In your game a lot of the time the DM is saying \u201cYou do this, this and this. Roll a twenty-sided!\u201d and you reply \u201c1d20 + 7 = 8\u201d and he says \u201cOK the enemy does this, this and this! Roll a twenty-sided!\u201d and you reply \u201c1d20 = 16\u201d and he says \u201cOh wow, it almost this this but you this and this and this! And then you this and this and this! Roll a twenty-sided!\u201d and you reply \u201c1d20 + 7 = 21\u201d and he says \u201cno you almost this but then this and this, and suddenly a big this!!!! wow! roll a twenty-sided!\u201d and you go NATURAL TWENTY! and everyone cheers.<br/><br/>And I\u2019m like\u2026 wait when are you doing things except just listing numbers? Sometimes. Creating characters. Talking about the scenario before the game. </blockquote>\nUnfortunately you got tripped up by the nature of the communicating in a textural medium.  What isn't being accounted for, because it would be such a verbose process, is all the somatic stuff we're doing at the table.  Much but not all, granted, of the GM saying "you do this" or "you do that" is his verbalizing our mimed actions.  What you're hearing (or what I've posted) is only a part of the total communication process and for the most part is the lesser part during combat.  Numbers are part of that communicative process.  They point at the <i>relative</i> boon or bust of fate at that moment but the specifics come from the SIS which equals GM description.  How (not what) he describes these events is a matter of style and mood and in the case of combat at our table the mode of description is designed to be as exciting and dramatic as possible.  Those die rolls are part of that excitement because we don't know exactly what will come of them.  We have to be deeply focused on the value of the numbers because of just how granular the combat is on a somatic level.  IOW we have to be prepared to react instantly to a result that isn't what we hoped.\n<blockquote>But some of the time it\u2019s the DM saying what you do. \u201cYou go in.\u201d \u201cYou crash through the door.\u201d \u201cYou pull out your knife.\u201d That is not same logic processes I engage in real life.</blockquote>\nMost of this is covered in the above portion of the post, but I'm not seeing how these example statements invalidate the process of us players working out what is going on in the world - including such intangibles as the significance of any event, if any.  Granted much of this is background but it does serve the purpose of maintaining the baseline of the world.  Its when events stray from the necessary baseline that we engage the logic process.  That logic process demands a baseline in order to work.  To point to instances of baseline stuff as evidence of how the logic process doesn't work or apply misses the whole point of the baseline.<br/><br/>There is more of your post to cover and I will get there as soon as I can.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484629/#Comment_484629" name="Item_180" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-29T21:56:56+00:00" title="May 29, 2019  9:56PM">May 29</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, if that\u2019s your position, we have nothing to disagree on.

It\u2019s not about math tactics, it\u2019s about creating an emotional response in the player that matches the intended diegetics (although I do take care so that the math tactics line up with what\u2019s emotionally engaging diegetically; i.e.\xa0you don\u2019t want the \u201cbest\u201d move on the dice layer to be something completely unnatural and boring, a la the problem Magic ran into with the Odyssey expansion giving your patrol hounds first strike seven times, completely reduntantly, just so that you could have enough cards in your graveyard to fuel some other spell\u2014I (and Cary) have someawareness of the dice-level tactical implications of the rules we design to prevent bad gameplay like that).</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>He created this mechanic so that the players of high level characters never stop fearing (read - experiencing) for their lives in combat - even against your bog standard issue, Mark I, first level Orc.

To answer your question in short - No.  Never once can I remember a game that came anywhere near to what Paul had described.<br/><br/>Now the longer reply.  Our chosen <i>style</i> of game is epic heroic.  A slow death to the elements just isn't part of the experience.  FREX - instead of the piece being irrevocably broken it might just be badly damaged and need time to be repaired.  Time that is not in abundance due to an extremely limited oxygen supply.  We would also find that the planet wasn't so uninhabited afterall.  So now we've got a ticking clock, a possible way out, action/hostile foes and longs odds on hope.<br/><br/>Just before I joined the group there was a scenario that was very similar to what Paul described but set in ME.  A ship had been caught in a storm and blown to a deserted island.  The ship had been damaged and needed repairs to be seaworthy again.  Food and water were in short supply.  To keep thing moving the players had to explore the island for supplies whereby they found not one living creature.  They quickly surmised something "bad" was on the island and raced against time to build a small stockade as the sun relentlessly trekked across the sky.  Sure enough there were ghouls on the island and to make matters worse a PC had got caught outside the stockade when the sun went down.  Apparently it was a new player and his face got so red (and a vein starting bulging on his forehead) that the GM actually stopped running to ask if the player was OK.  Apparently the fear was this player was going to have a stroke or a heart attack.  Seriously.  Needless to say his character died a hideous death.<br/><br/>However after the game when asked what he thought of his experience.  He answered, hands trembling as he lit up a smoke, "That was the most amazing experience of my life.  I'll never do that again.  I play to relax."<br/><br/>I'm sure this is obvious to anyone whose read any of my AP posts, we don't play a Klockwerk game.  Situations are always introduced to increase levels of tension.  One of the techniques our GM uses is to have at least one and usually several NPCs with the group to create or ratchet up conflict so all conflict isn't always just environmental - that being monsters or nature.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager

To me it all comes down to preference.<br/><br/>I have definitely had the feeling some people are expressing, where I love PbtA games but I wonder if it\u2019s possible to make them a bit less wiggly and fiat feeling. I\u2019ve played and MCed PbtA probably only a dozen times so take the following with a grain of salt. I always felt like if a PCs character happed to die it would be because of a choice I made as a MC rather than a natural result of the mechanics. <br/><br/>Maybe I didn\u2019t understand the rules well but that is how it felt and there\u2019s something I don\u2019t like about that. It takes away the true danger of the situation and makes character death into a player\u2019s decision (the MCs) wherein death doesn\u2019t seem random and there could be bad feelings between players. <br/><br/>I would like a PbtA game where the real risk of death was present and things were a bit more cut and dry, and didn\u2019t feel so dependent upon the MCs improved choices. The game I MCed was The Sword, the Crown and Unspeakable Power, which is a great game. I\u2019ve also played AW and DW. Maybe I MCed it in a different way than typical? Is this impression I\u2019m getting accurate or is death more a cut and dry and the result of game mechanics and the fudging was on my end? <br/><br/>Maybe it is the sense that your making up enemies on the spot sometimes, which can feel arbitrary, rather than preparing the encounters beforehand. It might be nice to do a sandbox kind of thing with PbtA so it felt a bit less arbitrary and MC determined? Obviously, the drama is the main point of most PbtA games and character death isn\u2019t the focus but it would be nice, for personal tastes, to make if it felt less wiggly. <br/><br/>Edit: I just read Kenny_J\u2019s response on the \u201cAre there non-trad, non-d&amp;d sandbox games?\u201d which went into the idea of doing a PbtA sandbox style game. I think it would do a good job addressing some of looseness and helping to make the game feel more solid and less MC fiat dependent. Kenny\u2019s got some really cool ideas.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484724/#Comment_484724" name="Item_204" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-30T19:48:27+00:00" title="May 30, 2019  7:48PM">May 30</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I'm sure this is obvious to anyone whose read any of my AP posts, we don't play a Klockwerk game.

I basically just mean the different general RPG game design categories often appeal to different tastes. But I definitely agree that there is a big difference between a good game and a bad game within those categories. For example, their are a lot of GMless games that just leave the players hanging and don\u2019t do a sufficient job of reconstituting some of the stuff the GM does.<br/><br/>I was basically trying to say something like the following: I like both D&amp;D and PbtA games, and there are bad designs within those two different game design categories, but that D&amp;D and PbtA have different features and they can both be good games but just appeal to people with different tastes. But I agree that some games are better than others and if one is discussing design it\u2019s necessary to make judgments about that if one is going to get anywhere.  <br/><br/>To tell you the truth, I\u2019m kind of lost on this thread; I haven\u2019t posted in a while and I\u2019m not caught up with the topics you all have been discussing and the new jargon you all are using\u2014I\u2019m seriously not even sure I totally understand what the conversation is about.

You get a lot of stuff happening, a lot of hi-jinx, but it\u2019s emotionally unsatisfying. The mechanics tend to get used to introduce \u2018stuff\u2019 rather than resolve conflicts on the dramatic level.<br/><br/>Most 90\u2019s games fail (for Narrativism) because the situation isn\u2019t strong and the characters are weak. There\u2019s no shared interesting in \u2018resolving the already untenable situation\u2019, so instead the GM ends up introducing elements ad-hoc to make things interesting. The problem is that interesting is ill defined.<br/><br/>If we\u2019re on the same page about what\u2019s interesting and committed to playing to find out, then no-myth elements are less intrusive because the character actions are still consequential.<br/><br/>If you\u2019re not on the same page then games like Apocalypse World create different versions of the \u2018quantum ogre\u2019 problem. Either our choice is inconsequential because the GM just fudges behind the scenes (for drama) or the resolution system ends up introducing \u2018ogres for drama\u2019 rather than actually resolving the conflict we want resolved.<br/><br/>Or to put it in entirely different terms. Apocalypse World relies on the spirit of emergence more than it does on mechanically nailing things down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aik" title="Aik"><img alt="Aik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aik">Aik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484733/#Comment_484733" name="Item_210" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-30T21:35:12+00:00" title="May 30, 2019  9:35PM">May 30</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the previously mentioned Lady Blackbird game with the dragon is a pretty good 'no blorb is good too' example. The game wasn't gelling, the laid-out setpiece wasn't really going anywhere. So, the GM pulls a dragon out, and boom - everyone is enthused and really into it. That kind of spontaneity and ability to react to the situation at hand with whatever inspires you as you go is powerful. I don't think the players' reaction to finding out that there's no myth there afterwards is especially relevant to how good the play was - that's just them being ignorant of the game - but with a clued-in group that wouldn't matter.<br/><br/>Games like Lady Blackbird work well because they give you enough preprepared stuff to springboard off and a narrow enough scenario that you don't get lost, but the implementation details are up the players/GM. The GM bounces off the players, takes their input, and outputs something that's highly tailored to what they want to do. <br/><br/>There are narrativist games that I think would be improved by blorb as well. Off the cuff - the ones that would be improved by it are games where NPCs have an independent mechanical existence (stats, I guess), or where the solidity of the setting is important. Poison'd is the first thing that comes to mind, and I've run it enough times to know that my make-it-up-as-you-go approach generally doesn't improve things.<br/><br/>More freewheeling games are fine without this - having the GM freely incorporating ideas they crib from the players and reintegrating stuff that comes up offhand is a powerful technique.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484735/#Comment_484735" name="Item_211" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-30T21:39:51+00:00" title="May 30, 2019  9:39PM">May 30</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2019 4:48AM by Paul_T.">edited May 31</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>I know the burden of proof was initially on me for making such a bold statement: \u201call games that tread on the toes of blorb need to be blorb (games that, by being sufficiently hippie have ensured that they don\u2019t look or feel blorby don\u2019t need to be blorby)\u201d.</p><p>But I\u2019ve given plenty of reasons for why I think that.</p></div></blockquote>\nOk!

I think we've been covering a lot of them in these conversations, but I can reference a few. I think <a href="/forums/profile/DeReel">@DeReel</a> basically has it, in their rather more pithy statement, above, but we can expand:<br/><br/>* The example of "the NPC to create drama" Jay described is a good one. There's nothing at all blorby about either a) making sure there's always an NPC around who could create drama, nor b) using that NPC to create drama whenever it's needed.<br/><br/>The benefits over strict blorb seem pretty obvious, too: there is always tension and drama, and the GM can "steer" things more in that direction, to create more exciting play for the players.<br/><br/>* I mentioned the thought experiment of a version of Apocalypse World where all the "choose from a list" moves and options were randomized instead. Isn't it obvious how that would harm the game and make it worse? (It is to me; we can discuss it more if someone finds it not so.)<br/><br/>* The "ice moon" scenario, and similar frustrating experiences (TPKs, for instance) never need happen, because we can always improvise/create new material to keep the game and the story moving. (I'm fairly confident at this point that someone like Cary would have improvised something interesting on the ice moon, had that been his game, and we would have had several hours of exciting, engaging play, instead of sitting around being angry at each other.)<br/><br/>And a new one, which is huge:<br/><br/>* Working with principled prep and consistent resolution methods means that we need to, by definition, treat similar qualities and quantities the same. We can't, for example, resolve one instance of trap-finding one way and another one a different way, simply because we're not interested, the GM has a cool idea, or it's late at night.<br/><br/>If you drop that restriction, you can zoom in and out much more freely, to create tension, drama, excitement, and to follow your interests as players and as a group. You can get straight to the stuff that interests everyone, and spend more of your playtime focused on that.<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>In something like 2097e, when you come to a small town looking for a particular person, we might have a procedure to follow for whether we find them or not. We might end up dicing it out only to find that, no, you don't find them, or play through interactions with other characters, while we try to puzzle out their identity. It's exciting and it challenges the players, but there is lots of room for "dead air", wasting time, or anticlimactic resolution.<br/><br/>In a game like AW, the MC has the tools to offer the PCs an interesting dilemma instead ("offer an opportunity with strings attached", or something like that) and then frame an exciting and dramatic scene with that person, set up to maximize the potential for interesting interactions, danger, romance, and thematic weight. (Instead of finding them in a random place and at a random time, we can think like a movie director and "find them" at dusk, with their child in their arms, bleeding to death.)<br/><br/>By the way, I agree 100% with <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">@Jeff_B_Slater</a> that most PbtA games are far too "loose" and dependent on MC judgement for proper "blorby" play. I'm not happy with how I expressed my thoughts on the matter back here, but we had a lengthy debate about it a few years back, and I still stand by my position:<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18672/is-aw-suited-to-gamist-challenge-based-play/p4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18672/is-aw-suited-to-gamist-challenge-based-play/p4</a><br/><br/><br/>EDIT: one more<br/><br/>* The ability to adjust the game on the fly (and quickly) to suit player interests and priorities, in ways that allow us to get to the 'good stuff' fluidly and efficiently, even if we started out with the wrong premises (by accident, or due to lack of skill). We can adjust to each other easily and in real time, and expand into new areas in a way which having to retool the ruleset and prep doesn't allow without a lot of work, not only in the game itself but outside of playtime, as well.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484736/#Comment_484736" name="Item_212" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-30T21:40:57+00:00" title="May 30, 2019  9:40PM">May 30</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're curious about how a game like AW manages to straddle the "trad" format but still produces more story-oriented play, we've had some discussion of that here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21417/apocalypse-world-and-pvp-sex-and-gore/p1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21417/apocalypse-world-and-pvp-sex-and-gore/p1</a><br/><br/>(Mostly the first three or four posts are relevant.)<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21327/how-much-power-does-the-gm-have-in-powered-by-the-apocalypse-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21327/how-much-power-does-the-gm-have-in-powered-by-the-apocalypse-games</a><br/><br/>(This is one if much more thorough.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Khimus" title="Khimus"><img alt="Khimus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Khimus">Khimus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484742/#Comment_484742" name="Item_213" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T04:11:40+00:00" title="May 31, 2019  4:11AM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>I know the burden of proof was initially on me for making such a bold statement: \u201call games that tread on the toes of blorb need to be blorb (games that, by being sufficiently hippie have ensured that they don\u2019t look or feel blorby don\u2019t need to be blorby)\u201d.</p><p>But I\u2019ve given plenty of reasons for why I think that. It would be cool/fair if you guys (well, some of you have come around and/or some of you were already kinda with me on this) also gave some reasons beyond just \u201cit\u2019s been my experience that unblorbiness is cool\u201d.</p><p>Because it sounds to me like either the blorby parts are the cool parts (the death of guy on ghoul island, once he was outside the blockades, def sounded like the application of Karma&amp;Fortune rather than Drama [to use Everway terms]), or the game is sufficently hippyfied to not qualify for the scaffolding necessary for blorbiness in the first place.</p></div></blockquote>\nFor me, the benefit of unblorb is that you can pack a full story arc in few sessions, while having most moments of play be dramatic and pointing to the premise. You don't waste time fighting filler monsters or undertaking routine tasks for the sake of fairness or internal consistency. Most of us get feed on stories constantly and have a gut feel for dramatic moments, and that's what many of us appreciate in a game. Could I play 20 sessions until a character survives long enough for a story to develop and a climax to build up, purely for diegetic reasons? Not very likely. The epic campaigns I've had in 10-12 sessions, sometimes even less, with DW, BW or AW would undertake many more sessions with blorby play.<br/><br/>Me other argument is that roleplaying is telling stories around a campfire, with rules. Many of us instinctively know that this is all made up in the spot, that no SIS exists prior to the act of play. The game and the world and the story are the words we speak. Thus, games operate on a narrative logic where different rules dictate what we may or may not accept as a valid outcome. Here, it's all about narrative and even this focus on blorby content is a narrative genre. So, applying narrative rules like moves isn't "arbitrary", it's in fact quite consistent when well executed, because we all have a sense for climax, pacing, spotlight, drama, etc. It is a style to be practiced and refined as much as the discipline required to GM a blorby game. And the effects of perfectly nailing the scene towards which the tension's been building is perfectly evident in players' reactions.<br/>I'd argue that players need discipline even when they mostly play their characters in story games. I've had players ignore baits for flags they had stated, portray their characters in weird ways they can't justify. So even in traditional story now games, players have a HUGE responsibility if they want a great campaign to unfold, so that's already a big difference with other traditional games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" title="Silmenume"><img alt="Silmenume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">Silmenume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484747/#Comment_484747" name="Item_214" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T05:18:57+00:00" title="May 31, 2019  5:18AM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Sandra,\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenune">@Silmenune</a> - I'm sure this is obvious to anyone whose read any of my AP posts, we don't play a Klockwerk game.

Kinda the biggest problem I had with <abbr title="Burning Wheel">BW</abbr>/ Mouse Guard. Yes it was sad that our mouse friend died but the GM kinda made that happen by putting that bird in our path. It wasn\u2019t a <em>real</em> bird. The good part of the game was tryna play our characters to the hilt, play to our beliefs and such.</p><p>I\u2019ve sometimes pejoratively thought the same thing about the worst of the \u201cadventure paths\u201d:</p><p>In the context of Robin\u2019s Laws player types <small>(yes I know the later book he did for WotC added \u201cinstigator\u201d and a few more)</small>, a big flaw of those types were that they all presupposed playing along with the railroad. There was no \u201cmy kick is to forge my <em>own</em> destiny\u201d or similar. <em>Given the railroad</em>, of course I\u2019m gonna be a \u201cmethod actor\u201d or w/e, that\u2019s the only thing I <em>can</em> do that isn\u2019t being shot down by the GM as being disruptive. And the book is so utterly dismissive of the method actor. \u201cGive them some kinda weird mirror or something so they can enjoy themselves\u201d.</p><p>The \u201cfun\u201d of the game becomes method acting; and given the solid challenge that <em>other real people</em> provide, that can get heavy and <em>good</em>.

Sometimes they say "We spend a two days going through the building; throughout search. We use chalk to mark which places have been searched already. What do we find?"<br/><br/>However, what one typically would not do is glossing over difficulties or uncertainties with mere narration, in the style of "After travelling for days and outwitting some trolls, you finally reach the mountain. You sneak past the orc horde and find your brother on the top floor of the tower.". Unless the characters are powerful enough, the integrity of the fiction would require some representation of the risk and uncertainty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484754/#Comment_484754" name="Item_219" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T05:57:31+00:00" title="May 31, 2019  5:57AM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>Hi Sandra,</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenune">@Silmenune</a> - I\u2019m sure this is obvious to anyone whose read any of my AP posts, we don\u2019t play a Klockwerk game.

The very fact that Esmeralda turning into a vampire is very unlikely means that it's <i>so much more meaningful</i>.<br/><br/>However, for a group that doesn't value the objectivity as much, the advantage is precisely the inverse: that this cool moment - Esmeralda turning into a vampire - can happen pretty much every time they play.<br/><br/>They don't have to wait through ten sessions where Esmeralda <i>doesn't</i> turn into a vampire. They can effectively "fast forward" to the moment where she does, and play that out.<br/><br/>They're trading off <i>frequency and consistency</i> of "cool moments!" for the <i>impact</i> of those cool moments. Kind of a quality vs. quantity thing, I suppose, to put it crudely.<br/><br/>But then if you imagine that the ability to <i>come up with those moments</i> is the skill the players want to use as often as possible, non-blorby play gives them far more opportunities to do so.<br/><br/>In one case it's a rare thing that only happens when the gloracle wills it. In the other, you've removed the gloracle so that you can do it all the time, at every session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" title="Silmenume"><img alt="Silmenume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">Silmenume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484763/#Comment_484763" name="Item_226" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T06:26:39+00:00" title="May 31, 2019  6:26AM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Sandra, <br/><br/>I said that only a small percentage of new players make the cut.

It's a tradeoff, though, with all the other things I'm listing. Some people like it and some people don't! I can see the appeal of both sides, frankly (as you know, I'm a big fan of "blorb" and principled prep; I just wouldn't use it in this style of gaming, where it will just get in the way of the fun).<br/><br/>So, then, where does the drama come from? You describe it well here:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>That is the bigges strike <em>for</em> blorb of all time though.

Only tell a story <em>about</em> tension, drama or excitement.</p></div></blockquote>\nYou are so right!<br/><br/>So, then, why doesn't everyone do that?<br/><br/>1. Some people really don't want to "create real tension". They very much want to "tell a story about tension, drama, or excitement". That's more fun for them. They don't like the real tension; they like the storytelling. <br/><br/>It's a different kind of pleasure. I enjoy it sometimes. A lot.<br/><br/>2. However! Non-blorby games can still totally have real tension, drama and excitement. My favourite kind of non-blorby game has strict and solid, tangible resolution mechanics for what happens next, which puts very real stakes on the line.<br/><br/>An easy example is any game which allows you to stake your character's life on a particular instance of conflict resolution. (You've played Dogs, you said: that's a game that does this well. You can always choose to "give" in a conflict if you don't want to take more fallout. This means that your life is never on the line except when you choose it to be... and <i>that</i> becomes the rare, impactful, powerful, memorable thing, instead. Except it's based on pure player choice instead of random gloracular outcomes. In this sense, it's more pure; it happened because it was that important to you, not because the dice happened to fall that way this one time.)<br/><br/>Much like how those anticlimactic moments in "blorby" play make it even better, as you wrote earlier:<br/><br/>"The possibility for anticlimactic resolution makes climactic resolutions awesomer."<br/><br/>The version of that in Dogs is something like:<br/><br/>"The possibility of folding in any conflict means that those times when you <i>do</i> choose to risk your life for something you care about, it really <i>means something</i>."<br/><br/>That's a form of drama and excitement that's really tangible and really cool, and doesn't rely on blorb or prep in any meaningful way.<br/><br/>It's also super intense and super fun!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484771/#Comment_484771" name="Item_229" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T06:51:53+00:00" title="May 31, 2019  6:51AM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not to be contrarian, but I don't personally feel like you can have real tension because of the inherent fictional nature of the events. Unless you're like, playing with actual bodily harm on the table or something, but it's safe to assume that ya'll aren't (I hope!).<br/>It's all fabricated. It's just a matter of how you present that fabrication, and personal preference. The stakes and tension you buy into will always feel more real to you than the ones you don't buy into. Blorb isn't inherently any more real. It's just what you buy into the most. And like, this is coming from a place of that I've played blorb games, and I'm not the type who buys in that kind of way. They were the most artificial thing imaginable to me. It didn't feel at all like life. It felt like a computer simulation at best to me. <br/>And yeah. Just something to think about on the topic of "real" vs. "not real".

But they make a *terrible* protagonist in an "action movie" kind of story, and same goes for a romantic comedy.<br/><br/>Removing certain elements of "blorb" and allowing a more freewheeling approach can really free up players to play characters who are interesting and don't make "optimal" choices, which are often the most interesting characters in our favourite stories.<br/><br/>That can have quite an impact on games, as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484783/#Comment_484783" name="Item_238" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T07:35:43+00:00" title="May 31, 2019  7:35AM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2019 7:37AM by Paul_T.">edited May 31</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>You misunderstood what I meant.

I'd have to think about that.)<br/><br/>But a game can have all kinds of traditional elements but not "full blorb". Sorcerer and Apocalypse World (or whatever; pick your own example!) have a traditional player/GM split and all that but don't include mechanics for "getting lost on an ice moon". (And I would argue that it's because the designers were well aware of this potential pitfall and designed smartly around it.)\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>answer two is that blorb isn\u2019t being taught.

It requires time, attention, constant tweaking (rulings, updating prepped material, etc), discipline, lots of trial and error, course correcting, and so on.<br/><br/>You do well because you clearly put a lot of time and effort and thought into it. For some people, it's very impractical (maybe they have no time to prep at all; maybe they have a learning disability - whatever).<br/><br/>It's not an "easy" approach; some other, looser approaches are much more practical for people.

It's simply an example, first of all - there are many such forms of "tangibility" in non-blorby games, and, for me, at least, Narrativist play depends pretty heavily on them. <br/><br/>But, more importantly, the dynamic I described wouldn't be any less true in a game that didn't have prep but used Dogs mechanics. The fact that the GM is expected to prep a Town doesn't change that fact. (It occurs in other ways in Apocalypse World, for instance, even in the first session. And, in theory, it could come into play in an initiation conflict in Dogs, too, which is explicitly unprepped in any way.) <br/><br/>The prep here is a total red herring; the key is that all kinds of interactions in play can result in tension, drama, and uncertainty. Sticking to principled prep is just one of many ways to achieve that (and, for many people, a highly unreliable way to get there, depending on what they value or care about).<br/><br/>(Remember <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20681/burned-at-the-stake-rpg-ruleset-for-passionate-characters-at-risk" rel="nofollow">these rules</a>, for example?

I am eager to transfer the concepts I'm gleaning to my forum-resistant group and having evocative terms helps.<br/><br/>I would say my two preferred styles of play are:<br/><br/>a) No-prep (not counting day-dreaming or aesthetic prep), cut right to the drama, frame every scene around a core theme or premise. (I call this Narrativist but I know that's a loaded term).  Kingdom, Follow, and my fav PbtAs (AW and Masks) do this well.<br/><br/>b) High-prep, what's on the page can't be changed (I mostly run adventure sites by <a href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">@Fuseboy</a>, <a href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">@Thor_O</a>, etc ), pacing is baked into the rule-set, follow the players around and adjudicate as transparently and consistently as possible.<br/><br/>These are both fun for totally different reasons.  I love the feeling of "getting it right" by adding in a plausible, well-foreshadowed twist in a system where you have the leeway to introduce new elements freely.  I also love when my hand is off the wheel (like the randomly rolled vampire hunter-turned vampire) and happen to get a satisfying result.  In the latter example (Klockwork), the core gameplay loop needs to be fun, satisfying enough that I'm not drumming my fingers waiting for an emergent plot development that might never get rolled.<br/><br/>I have played some systems that are designed for relatively Klockwork play (not in it's platonic form, but there are degrees) and I like them a lot less when they GM takes a tighter rein over events.<br/><br/>For example, Torchbearer is my go-to system for this kind of play.  However, it sometimes falls pretty far short of this bar.<br/><br/>In one scenario, the GM has a map of dungeons prepped and says "Here are the travel rules.  Go for it."  It's totally up to the players which dungeons they engage with, when they retreat to town, how they address the threats at each location, etc.  This allows for nearly full-Klockwork play.  They risks and rewards are tangible and the GM has no tools for steering them in one direction or another.<br/><br/>In another scenario, the GM shows up each week with a dungeon prepped and tells the players how they get hooked into the adventure.  I often end up playing in this mode; it's the only way to playtest an adventure site on a reasonable timeline, or run for only a couple of sessions without wasting prep.  The Klockwork factor here is way lower.  It still works, and the players have plenty of leeway in the environment (there's no hard-scene framing by the GM after the adventure is started) but it's a significant difference.<br/><br/>My other example is complex enough that I am going to make a new thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484797/#Comment_484797" name="Item_247" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T12:57:14+00:00" title="May 31, 2019 12:57PM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2019 1:02PM by DeReel.">edited May 31</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good workshoping going on and I've missed so much. A bit metaphysical at times (the reality of fiction etc.) ;p <br/>Simulating a world or a story genre, the random generator of dramatic incidients, all this reminds me of Spinozza's physics : there are things and the relations between things, which are a sort of thing in their own way. This kind of distinction really benefits from being cleanly built from the ground up. Else, we navigate between clouds and dice but without knowing where the interlocutor is.<br/><br/>I want to emphasis a point : that you can (and I'd argue it's always the case) have the whole table merely move air only half heartedly, and then a ping pong ball could float on that air stream, and that's when things begin to feel real. I like a good "(fishing line) plunger" mechanic to detect this moment, Rickard's postural vote in Imagine being my model at the moment. There's no more reality before than after. It's called intensity, and it's common to take it for truth or reality, because it's really convincing. "Intensity" meaning is wider than "fun" (a useful distinction when talking about character death).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484811/#Comment_484811" name="Item_248" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T16:23:24+00:00" title="May 31, 2019  4:23PM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2019 4:28PM by 2097.">edited May 31</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p><a href="/forums/profile/moconnor">@moconnor</a>, we might be pretty much on the same page</p><p><a href="/forums/profile/Khimus%E2%80%A6">@Khimus\u2026</a></p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Khimus" rel="nofollow">Khimus</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Khimus" rel="nofollow">Khimus</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>there\u2019s nothing routine about fighting a monster that can kill you or making sure you don\u2019t rack up too many starvation days that can kill you.</p></div></blockquote><p>Sandra, if you can\u2019t concede that:</p><ol><li>Some people aren\u2019t interested in random encounters.</li><li>Fighting to death every fight for no reason is not interesting in every genre.

other than as a metaphor, the act of roleplaying is not a trip, but a collective narration, right? Not talking about agendas and any of that stuff, but of the social act of playing. If an anthropologist were to observe us while we play, he wouldn't say we're having a trip.<br/>So, for me, talking about genres is actually more pertinent in my opinion.

This was a wilderness exploration game with an open table, two GM's, multiple games per week, etc.  I played in a dozen sessions out of around 50.<br/><br/>This game was in "full-blorb" mode.  My friend and the other GM prepared everything extensively and shared all their notes to keep things consistent.  They made a bunch of changes to the moves and playbooks of Dungeon World to remove anything that involved making things up on the spot, and though I did not see the GM-side rules, it's my understanding that they also added more detailed rules and guidelines to the game about which moves could be used in which circumstances, in order to ensure the world worked consistently when switching GM's.<br/><br/>From my point of view the underlying consistency / prep / no-fudge attitude was obvious.  Telltale signs included (as Paul would predict) occasional boring sessions where we went out exploring somewhere and didn't find much of anything, and the occasional player death due to bad decisions and bad dice rolls.  This was very much what I had signed up for and I thought it was obvious that this was what the game was going to be like from the GMs' pitch.<br/><br/>However, there were other players who had a very hard time accepting the fact that the GM would not contradict his rules or prep.  This was especially the case with experienced Dungeon World players.  There was one player who was always at odds with the GM, trying to insert his own ideas or getting frustrated when his solution to a problem was foiled by the hidden parameters of the problem.  There were one or two other players who blamed the GM when their character died (although they had gone into an obviously dangerous area and performed obviously dangerous actions).  And there was somebody else who complained the GM used the "deal damage" move too often in combat, rather than offering them interesting choices.  Several of these players quit the game in frustration.<br/><br/>So, this game was a case where the presence of a game with non-traditional mechanics (Dungeon World) caused (some) players to have the wrong "anti-blorb" expectations.  Basically the opposite problem to the one this thread has been talking about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484822/#Comment_484822" name="Item_256" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T17:40:28+00:00" title="May 31, 2019  5:40PM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's also a big level for me where my intent inherent lack of buy-in to blorb is a product of how strongly I'm against worldbuilding in fiction.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484824/#Comment_484824" name="Item_257" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T17:47:18+00:00" title="May 31, 2019  5:47PM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (BTW before I dig into these new replies I want to add something)<br/><br/>I am aware that "I used to believe what you folx believe but now I my position is this complete opposite thing" doesn't mean that I am right and isn't a valid line of <i>argument</i> or <i>reason</i> or whatever.<br/><br/>All it <i>does</i> mean is that "I don't believe X" isn't a good argument from y'all since I used to not believe X either so I don't put a lot of stock into not believing X in-and-of-itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484825/#Comment_484825" name="Item_258" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T17:54:17+00:00" title="May 31, 2019  5:54PM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" rel="nofollow">EmmatheExcrucian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>There\u2019s nothing wrong with \u2018narrativium\u2019.

Like I mentioned the GM's had some additional rules and procedures that they were using that were not player-facing.  (That was part of the premise of the game--you are exploring a mysterious world, you don't know its rules, can you figure them out and use them to survive?

The players upset about dying may have been used to GM's fudging results to save their beloved characters.<br/><br/>I can't give a completely certain answer since it was a few years ago, and it is about the expectations of other people who are not me, and I heard about some of these complaints and conflicts second-hand from the GM.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I should mention that the majority of the players did understand and accept the blorby (clockwork?  that's a good word for it) nature of the game.\n<blockquote>I\u2019m learning about Freebooters of the Frontier which seems to be more of a blorby take on DW?</blockquote>\nI think the GM in this game mentioned he had looked into that but found it was designed more for randomly generated wilderness adventures than for the full Ben Robbins deep history approach.

Perhaps it will help someone! <br/><br/>1. In Sandra's style of gaming, there is an agreed upon method (all the gloracle, prep, procedures of play, and GM style/technique) which serves as the "foundation" for play. It's consistent and solid and players know what to expect. This lends a tremendous "solidity" or "tangibility" to play which is enjoyable, and makes things feel more "real".<br/><br/>2. Some people don't care about solidity and tangibility and just want to tell stories in a freewheeling way. That's cool, too, but it's not what we're focusing on here. (In this style of gaming, we trust the players' judgement to make choices matter, instead of the procedural mechanics; instead of saying "here's a format for making choices matter", we say, "I trust each of us to make each others' choices matter by taking them into account as we create story". Just like "bad blorb" play, this can fail, but it can also work.)<br/><br/>3. In Narrativist play that seeks to feel real and solid, though, how does that work? Much like all the klockwerk which underlies 2097e, we need a solid foundation which grounds the game and makes choices matter. It's consistency of player roles, advocacy for characters, and consistent, principled resolution. I trust that you will play my opponent to the hilt, and fairly, while we have pre-established rules for how they interact and how we find out who "wins" or how it all turns out. We don't need to prep distances on a map, traps, or combat stats, because the conflicts we're interested in don't concern those things. We don't need rules for getting stranded on ice moons, but we <i>do</i> need rules for what it means when your character is willing to lose their life to stop mine from doing what he wants to do (for a simple example; each game will be different).<br/><br/>Once we establish the groundwork for these conflicts and solid, consistent methods for resolving them, we get emergent outcomes and exciting "real" play, just like with blorb methods.<br/><br/>(GM-as-storyteller, 90s play fails on both counts: first, the GM doesn't necessarily lay the groundwork for conflicts and stick to it, and, second, the methods for resolving them are either not consistently applied or hopelessly obscured. So this is very distinct from that.)<br/><br/>In those conversations about "what differentiates AW from traditional play", we talked about quite a few of these things. Unlike GM-mediated task resolution, which is famously open to interpretation and "cheating" (like the classic case of the GM asking for more and more rolls until you succeed), AW has all kinds of rules and procedures which produce solid, tangible outcomes we can't cheat around.<br/><br/>Good examples include that a) NPCs don't and can't arbitrarily have different numbers of hit points, and b) certain moves guarantee the PCs can hurt them reliably (so no NPC can be bulletproof), c) all kinds of moves guarantee players access to reliable and important information (like the reading moves, deep brain scan, and many others), and d) many rules and moves simply give the players the ability to create and state immutable facts about what things are and what they mean: for example, an advanced seduce/manipulate allows you to make any NPC into an "ally".<br/><br/>Those rules and restrictions all work with each other to produce emergent, tangible outcomes in a way that you don't get in "90s GM as storyteller" games. They are real and unexpected and lasting.<br/><br/>All of these design elements work against murky, unclear play, and ruin the possibility of a railroading GM trying to create the story they want. Add the explicit principles of play and play culture surrounding the thing, and you get something which is very, very distinct from 90s trad games, despite having lots of similarities at a level of procedures and techniques.<br/><br/>It's a nice middle ground between total No Myth and "full blorb", and it's a really fun and popular way to play. <br/><br/>You can get similar play from even more traditional rulesets if the GM is able and willing to adopt a strict and principled approach to how they create and adjudicate situations. This can look nothing like "blorb", but is similar in that it can be an objective and consistent, principled means of creating opposition and conflict which makes everything in play feel "more real".<br/><br/>In short, Sandra's objections about "non-blorb" play degenerating into 90s-style "GM moves the goalposts" nonsense are not entirely wrong (that can totally happen!), but they're trying to paint in black and white what is actually a wide spectrum that has so many different positions for a variety of fun and cool play, in different shades of grey.<br/><br/>(Again, Critical Role is a pretty fun example, in some ways. I see no reason to think that it's full-on "railroaded", linear play, but it has elements that are incredibly anti-blorby. Despite that, people clearly are enjoying themselves a lot. It's far less principled in this sense than AW, but neither is it "blorby", and certainly isn't a morass of horrible "GM moves the goalposts" nonsense which doesn't seem real to anyone. I see no reason to assume that if it was made "more blorby", the participants would enjoy the game more. Same goes for Cary's game. It would be a tradeoff, in both cases. They would gain some things and lose others - others that they really value.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484885/#Comment_484885" name="Item_291" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T22:47:30+00:00" title="May 31, 2019 10:47PM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Khimus" rel="nofollow">Khimus</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>A question for the blob-people:</p></div></blockquote><p>Please try to be kinder\u2665<br/>I\u2019m already bummed out enough<img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/></p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Khimus" rel="nofollow">Khimus</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>How do you deal with players bored or uninterested?

I usually just lurk, so this feels sorta awkward.<br/><br/>I share 2097s view that playing ttrpgs blorbily is very different from telling a story (or reading a story for that matter). It's still fiction, but the way I'm interacting with it is very different. <br/><br/>I remember my first contact with ttrpg "realness" and I think it's an interesting datapoint, because its almost the opposite of the mirror story.<br/><br/>We played DoD Chronopia, a truly unblorby 90s style game. The GM admitted to changing the stats of some soldiers once to save our lives. <br/><br/>Me and another player were escaping a dungeon. We'd been kidnapped by an unknown organisation and I figured we'd find some explanation of who they were and why we were there. We pretty soon came to a room with several doors (the GM painstakingly drew it up for us) and we opened one and anti-climactically found ourself out in the city once again. <br/><br/>It was a worthless story. The prepped map and our choices had been respected to the detriment of "excitement" - and I was thrilled! That dungeon was a real place with doors that opened up to rooms that we'd never see. It didn't have a satisfying narrative arc - and it felt like real life. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484891/#Comment_484891" name="Item_296" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-01T00:19:12+00:00" title="June  1, 2019 12:19AM">June 1</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2019 12:21AM by AsIf.">edited June 1</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Khimus" rel="nofollow">Khimus</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><blockquote>The invented dragon in AsIf\u2019s Lady Blackbird game.</blockquote></div></blockquote>\nOk, that's an interesting example. What I read here is the players were unclear on what the principles of this style of gaming were.<br/><br/>I'm late to the party, but what happened there was everyone except for one player being thrilled with the improved nature of the solution, while that other player was not.  So that's really a case of differing views within the group itself.  Just to clarify.  I'll go as far as to say that his previous experiences with other, more prepped games brought him to the table with a specific set of expectations that weren't Blackbirdesque.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Khimus" title="Khimus"><img alt="Khimus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Khimus">Khimus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484892/#Comment_484892" name="Item_297" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-01T00:26:31+00:00" title="June  1, 2019 12:26AM">June 1</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph" rel="nofollow">Jeph</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>So let's say we're playing Air Chess.<br/><br/>Air Chess is exactly like normal chess, but there's no physical board or game pieces.

Every step further you make away from chess rules makes it look more and more like fiction, and those awkward restrictions at how players signal their actions end up being a collective narration. For instance, if you were to explain the game to me like this, I'd instantly suggest dropping the names rule and having the board visible to everybody. Why use that, if this isn't fiction? I don't intent stories while playing settlers of Catan, it's a waste of time.<br/>I'd rather ground the discussion in actual play experiences.<br/>Take the standpoint of an external observer. He didn't read that over complicated explanation. He's just exposed to what they're saying and doing. He hears your example:   "Alice from Village of Homlett to Cave of the Blue Medusa," you say, "Alice walks from Homlett to the Cave," and I say, "They're two miles apart, so that'll take about 40 minutes. In that time, the water pouring into the cave rises another foot and a half."<br/>What is it, from a linguistical perspective? A narration. It's oral, shared, and participation is limited by rules. Is it a game, too? It has some elements common to games, but rules can fluctuate a lot ("physics") and there's no clear winning condition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484896/#Comment_484896" name="Item_298" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-01T05:05:26+00:00" title="June  1, 2019  5:05AM">June 1</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<small>Note to self if I ever get reincarnated: semantics worst degree of all time</small><br/><br/>\u2665Flanellis!!\u2665\u2665 My friend!<br/>Did you read the whole thread?

It's possible that you just designed a boring scenario or dungeon and players don't seem too engaged in terms of fun, even if they're invested in it because of their characters' goals. So they won't just go do something else.</p></div></blockquote>\nWe just had a talk at the end of previous session during which touched two points: The first is for players to take initiative if they want more to happen, and the second is for me to be more streamlined when they are approaching a dangerous location.<br/><br/>I have not really faced the situation you specifically ask about. I guess the core game of D&amp;D of going into dangerous situations and trying to survive is fun and interesting enough. A couple of times when the players did not really know what they were on about they just went into a nearby dungeon and did some basic dungeoncrawling. These expeditions often affect wider events, in turn, and make them more meaningful. For example, a goblin tribe deserting the dungeon and swearing vengeance, or a respected member of a bandit group being humiliated and losing status, to take two recent examples.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484904/#Comment_484904" name="Item_305" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-01T07:11:39+00:00" title="June  1, 2019  7:11AM">June 1</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" rel="nofollow">Thanuir</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The first is for players to take initiative if they want more to happen</p></div></blockquote>\nI've good experience with getting those kinda talks to actually work\u2665<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484905/#Comment_484905" name="Item_306" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-01T07:12:51+00:00" title="June  1, 2019  7:12AM">June 1</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the infinite chess board example has a point, but I would start elsewhere.<br/><br/>Nowadays there are several fantasy adventure board games with miniatures. Heroquest is the old classic and I am not familiar with the new ones. Descent, maybe?<br/><br/>I played through a tutorial of one of them with a friend. I had a hero figure I moved through a short corridor and there were skeletons coming from front and back. Maybe some timer. Thinking about it as a roleplayer, the first question was if I could jump over or run through the skeletons in front of me, rather than the long slog of rolling dice to kill them. The game did not have rules for this, so no.<br/><br/>What if I wanted a similar experience, but where I could jump over or sneak past the skeletons or crush them by toppling a pillar on top of them and so on? That is what OSR play gives to me, though the fact that social situations and interaction are also part of it is very important. (That is, the domain of play or game arena includes social interaction with non-player characters.)<br/><br/>Maybe this is relevant to the storytelling discussion; I have to admit to not being quite sure how it relates to the interesting claim of Sandra.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484906/#Comment_484906" name="Item_307" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-01T07:19:24+00:00" title="June  1, 2019  7:19AM">June 1</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" rel="nofollow">Thanuir</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>the fact that social situations and interaction are also part of it is very important.

Explain please the need for names to places and characters and "physics" for a board game.

I guess it depends on how exactly one interprets "90s game", but I feel it's pretty clearly being used around here as shorthand for something like a game that presents itself as blorb (to make all those best moments feel real) while using plenty of no-myth behind the scenes (to avoid slow deaths on icy moons and make sure those best moments come quickly and often). Which is deceptive by definition and incoherent by definition.<br/><br/>Actually, maybe it's incoherent only if you value blorb, or value no-myth? If both are subordinate to a third goal, then maybe mixing them and compromising both isn't incoherent at all? See Silmenume's game.<br/><br/>In fact, my experience has been that for a lot of people who come into RPGs, this is the default preference.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The big thing is that <strong>the blorb experience requires the five traditional techinques to work</strong>:</p><ul><li>information separation</li><li>resolution mechanics</li><li>each player character is only being run by one player each</li><li>identifying stance</li><li>GM plays world</li></ul><p>You need them to have blorb.

"Draw maps, leave blanks" is <i>exactly</i> what I love most of the time in RPGs.<br/><br/>There are a few key elements that need to be in place to make half-Myth work (just as for any other level of Myth). First off, obviously, the stuff that is pre-prepped can't just be ignored willy-nilly (for the sake of "story" or whatever). Second, you need to have some sort of veto process whereby people can't contradict that which has been introduced before. Essentially, you need good improv rules (this is true for no-Myth as well). When players author new facts about the setting, they have to <i>f e e l  r i g h t</i> for that world or story or for those characters.<br/><br/>One time when I was running my Burning Wheel Three Musketeers Scenario (a solidly half-Myth scenario in a solidly half-Myth game engine), two of the players created an NPC Spanish swordsman named Inigo. He was co-created by two players because he was a low-ranking guy that both the manipulative Baron and his seductive daughter were trying to use as a spy. He hadn't "existed" before the contested Circles roll that brought him forth. However, because characters like that fit so well with the genre, it was no problem for anyone's sense of immersion. Furthemore, Inigo's presence didn't undermine any of the Myth elements that are present in that scenario.<br/><br/>Now, here's the even trickier thing. You have to have an organizing principle for play that is <b>orthogonal</b> to blorb concerns. BW's principle of "fight for what you Believe" actually needs amount of both blorb and anti-blorb to really hum. There's no way to go full Myth with BW: it would rob players of too much agency, their characters of too much protagonism. But going full no-Myth is also impossible, except maybe in an initial session where you're all collaboratively establishing the conflicts and the setting. Full no-Myth is too... airy... for what BW is trying to do. (If you don't like BW, I'd say MLwM is similar.)<br/><br/>So, in the case of a well-constructed half-Myth game, what you have is not some failure to pursue an opportunity for blorb. Nor is it a full-on hippie game, though! (Those are cool, to be clear!) I never really realized before this thread just how crucial half-Myth is to making certain games work. Maybe it needs its own thread?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484960/#Comment_484960" name="Item_328" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-02T04:00:33+00:00" title="June  2, 2019  4:00AM">June 2</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2019 4:03AM by Paul_T.">edited June 2</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent, Matt (Deliverator).<br/><br/>I\u2019ve been trying to get at that for some time in this thread, but you said it in perhaps a much clearer way than my attempts so far.<br/><br/>I consider \u201chalf-Myth\u201d (or whatever we want to call it*) to be a really key and important playstyle and super fun as well as tremendously functional.<br/><br/>It\u2019s extremely popular among a new generation of gamers and they play it REALLY well.<br/><br/>As usual in these discussions, I find the laser focus on Technical concerns to be distracting us from the \u201cwhy\u201d or guiding principles behind play itself. \u201cFull blorb\u201d or \u201cfull Myth\u201d are somewhat illusory anyway, best seen as platonic ideals we as humans will never reach (and I don\u2019t think it would produce functional gaming even if we could!).<br/><br/>Any of these techniques can be used successfully when they are employed in the right ends (the proper creative goals), and any of them can totally suck when they are not guided by a clear idea of what role they\u2019re serving in the game (as in my ice moon story, which is as rigorously blorby as anything out there but absolutely miserable gaming).<br/><br/><br/>*: I\u2019m not sure I see this label as representing a meaningful category of game techniques, rather than just describing something that\u2019s not either of the other two types of game we\u2019re talking about, which we\u2019ve been referring to as something like \u201cfull blorb\u201d and \u201c90s Rule Zero GM storytelling\u201d.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484963/#Comment_484963" name="Item_329" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-02T05:03:51+00:00" title="June  2, 2019  5:03AM">June 2</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pretty much nodding along in agreement to that whole post, Paul.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484964/#Comment_484964" name="Item_330" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-02T05:40:05+00:00" title="June  2, 2019  5:40AM">June 2</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Lots of replies while it was night here in Europia!

But who knows, right? It\u2019s cool that cutting edge game design is going on. Like a war game dork in the 90\u2019s being all like \u201chex, counters, tables in books etc are necessary for a war game\u201d and the now people are like \u201cbut semantics on cards that you can shuffle up though?\u201d</p><p>What I\u2019m saying is that these five techniques are tools you use for blorb. If you have \u2019em, do blorb, blorb\u2019s awesome. If you\u2019re not doing blorb, no need to do be shackled down to all five these techniques.</p><p>Can you do blorb w/o these five techniques?

That\u2019s a consequence of my claims and radical enough to qualify as a claim in and of itself.</p><p>Before \u201cmirror story\u201d, I had played in extremely \u201cimmersive\u201d games (on the surface level) in the past. No dice, no out-of-character talk, no numbers, just narration in character in the dark. All diegesis all the time.</p><p>With the mirror story the game felt orders of magnitude more real. A thousand times more!</p><p>It\u2019s sorta like this guy\u2019s video (which came out like three years after than my \u201cmirror story\u201d experience):</p><p>Immersion\u2026 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xncs1mrMV6o" rel="nofollow">this video is a pretty good summary of a bunch of theories from other fields [video games] on immersion</a>; I disagree completely with that guy\u2019s <em>other</em> videos but that video is pretty good! Emma our resident immersion hater might dig it\u2665</p><p>What he is talking about is how solid mechanics are more appealing than realistic graphics.</p><p>By the time that video came out I had already split immersion up into two types myself: \u201cbuy-in immersion\u201d and \u201cstance immersion\u201d [sometimes I\u2019ve called that \u201c\u2018mood\u2019 immersion\u201d]. (Because 2097e is an in-person game and not a video game.)</p><p>Transparency of method increases buy-in [regardless of blorb presence\u2026 just knowing <em>how the game is set up</em> helps you buy into the stakes and premises] but distracts from stance immersion. I\u2019ve been thinking of making some sorta verifiable game record behind-the-screen app so you can postpone all the transparency of method to <em>after</em> the session. No more \u201croll a twenty-sided\u201d, instead we get all the benefits of my olden candle-lit days but with also having all the benefits of the actual gloracle. Maybe such a game would\u2019ve benefited from being simpler than D&amp;D 5e with its litany of spells and maneuvers and class features.</p><p>I was hoping to run Cthulhu Dark in a hyper immersive way, because it had simpler mechanics that could handle all cases situations, but I realized that the insight clock in it was kinda fighting against the finchian/lawsian resolution I value. If I were to play it again I\u2019d add in a \u201cbe finchian/lawsian or roll the dice\u201d rule. A \u201clook to Karma before you look to Fortune\u201d rule. Huh, that makes me think that maybe Everway is a better game for this experiment than Cthulhu Dark because it doesn\u2019t have the players making any kind of dice-level choices at all. You do all diegetic level choices and then your stats says what\u2019s happen.</p><p>These days I have better knowledge of IIEE and how to \u201cset up moves\u201d (\u201cthe ogre is drawing back his arms, swinging his fist directly at you, what do you do?\u201d), and better knowledge on how to prep porte-monstre-tr\xe9sor instead of prepping story. Drawing from a deck of shuffled, but selected and familiar, vision cards instead of rolling from an encounter table. Now I want to try this. IDK maybe that\u2019s dumb.

Would this be a satisfactory a rule set?<br/><br/>A random thought: A lot of the classic immersive play (we played for three sessions and only rolled dice twice) is focused on relationships. There is a lot of focus on characters talking to each other about their emotions and relationships. The wider fiction provides context for this, of course, and significant non-player characters there are important, but I would imagine that a much larger part of the game world is more inconsequental than in OSR-type challenge-focused play. Is there less need for a solid fiction in relationship-based play?<br/>An example might be characters organizing a birthday party for one of them and figuring out whom to invite and what kind of decorations and programme to have. Then playing out the party. We might want to know the layout of the building, because it might give creative input due to restrictions of space or force some characters to take more prominent positions during the festivities, but it all is far less important than a dungeon layout. A random encounter table is probably not necessary, though one could be used; a random party accident table might be useful, but I do not see it adding that much when compared to just considering who the characters are and coming up with something based on their personalities and quirks.<br/><br/>Immersive play; is a solid fiction of great importance?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484977/#Comment_484977" name="Item_337" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-02T16:02:57+00:00" title="June  2, 2019  4:02PM">June 2</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2019 4:03PM by 2097.">edited June 2</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" rel="nofollow">Thanuir</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Suppose you have played with the same game master for a while and you trust them so be as neutral an arbiter as possible, and they have a solidly prepared game setting available.

There is a lot of focus on characters talking to each other about their emotions and relationships. The wider fiction provides context for this, of course, and significant non-player characters there are important, but I would imagine that a much larger part of the game world is more inconsequental than in OSR-type challenge-focused play. Is there less need for a solid fiction in relationship-based play? An example might be characters organizing a birthday party for one of them and figuring out whom to invite and what kind of decorations and programme to have. Then playing out the party. We might want to know the layout of the building, because it might give creative input due to restrictions of space or force some characters to take more prominent positions during the festivities, but it all is far less important than a dungeon layout. A random encounter table is probably not necessary, though one could be used; a random party accident table might be useful, but I do not see it adding that much when compared to just considering who the characters are and coming up with something based on their personalities and quirks.</p></div></blockquote><p>Yeah, I\u2019ve written about this upthread:</p><p><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/484682/#Comment_484682" rel="nofollow">\u201creally strong player characters colliding <em>hard</em> against each other in a tight space\u201d</a></p><p><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/484791/#Comment_484791" rel="nofollow">\u201cTension, drama and uncertainty arise from tangible elements (such as player characters) colliding with each other.

First I'm getting confused by the use of "blorb".  In one presentation we have blorb presented as very specific type of game preparation technique.  In another "blorb" is being offered as game construct much like Story is employed in Narrativism.  Finally we have "blorb" being used as a method or process of play.  Is it all the above or one or more or something completely different?<br/><br/>Second - we use <i>all</i> the above bullet points on your list in the game that I play in.  I would like to point to you of a case of non-rpg case of immersion.  When the TV series "The Fugitive" ran in the 60's people used to call the police when they saw the actor David Janssen on the street.  Some members of the audience had so bought in to the fiction aired (immersed) that they failed to make the distinction between fiction and real life.  These were not people who suffered disassociative personality disorders but your average persons.  And they were totally passive in the process.  They were nothing but audience members with absolutely no agency to affect the fiction space.  I understand that watching a TV show and playing an RPG are not the same but my point is that "blorb" was not required to achieve a mental state where people thought the fiction was "real" and "tangible".<br/><br/>"Blorb" might be a valuable technique that works for you and your group and likely many others but it is not the only path to "immersion".<br/><br/>I also in agreement with <a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a> about "half-myth" which is really closer to how we play.  We play in ME but the books did not detail everything square mile of ME.  To just blanket assume that because the books or maps made of ME don't show every detail before play that nothing can ever happen or be in those spaces doesn't follow.  "There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy."<br/><br/>WRT formalizing every possible mechanic I did follow the link to Vincent's blog (lumpley) and noted the following - \n<blockquote>33. On 2008-04-16, Vincent said:<br/>Does formalizing rules rob them of their goodness? Absolutely yes, 100% of the time.<br/><br/>You want formal rules for the places your informal rules don't cover. I've never heard of, and can't imagine, a roleplaying group taking its working informal rules and imposing formality upon them.<br/><br/>I don't know any game designers who've successfully formalized their group's informal rules, either. My groups' informal rules have informed my game design, of course, but for none of my games have I ever just written down what we already do.</blockquote>\nWhile his general gist is that while formal mechanics help push players to unwelcome and unwanted events they also have the drawback of -\n<blockquote>I think it's inevitable that playing by formal rules will mean that some of the things you want to happen in a game, can't. <i>They cut off welcome events, whole domains at a time.</i> That's one of the biggest strengths of freeform play - that's why I say that live negotiation and <i>honest collaboration is more robust and flexible than any given formal ruleset.</i></blockquote>\nI think, though, that his arguments are aimed specifically towards Narrativist play.  In game negotiation of scenes is antithetical to Mythic Bricolage and, I presume, to Challenge based play.<br/><br/>I'll state this again Mythic Bricolage play does have a resolution mechanic - it's called Bricolage and it is not deterministic.  This is the very hang up that most people have with the idea of this mode of play.  Yet real world native tribes use this method to create their cognitive frame of reality.  If real humans beings do this for real purposes that underpin the totality of their cultures then why must it be any less able to create a "tangible, real" game <i>experience</i>?<br/><br/>What "blorb" seems to be is a Social Contract convention between the players and the GM. It is promise between the players that the GM will precreate everything that will happen in the game, will make their note available upon request after the game and not interfere with the Klockwerk.  Great!  It's a technique of play that really jazzes you and your players.  Can't argue with success.  But saying "blorb" is the only or even the best way to immersion is "One True Wayism" and that claim falls apart in light of my own experiences.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485003/#Comment_485003" name="Item_346" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T01:40:32+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  1:40AM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playing a true protagonist in the literary sense is very much the goal of BW and many of its relatives.

You "are" the author rather than the character, but you have one character that is your primary responsibility. There's something that makes me kind of uncomfortable around that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485011/#Comment_485011" name="Item_348" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T05:16:10+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  5:16AM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2019 5:17AM by 2097.">edited June 3</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>About \u201chalf-myth\u201d\u2026 A \u201cno myth\u201d game was defined as a game where things weren\u2019t true until they had been established in play; hadn\u2019t entered the SIS.

The players have one job and are expected to focus on that job: Their characters making actions in the game world.</dd></dl><p>For example, in the game Feng Shui, players are expected to stay out of the identifying stance in order to be able to invent detail about the SIS that matches their character\u2019s intent. \u201cI grab the plates from the table and start hurling them at the orc\u201d <em>without first asking \u201cAre there plates here?\u201d</em></p><p>This is a subversion of, or a hippiefication of, a traditional technique.</p><p>Similarly circles in Burning Wheel, as explained to me by <a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a>, subverts/hippifies all four of these techniques.</p><p>If a game strongly&amp;strictly maintains these four techniques, my understanding was that one of these three things is going on:</p><ul><li>It\u2019s a blorby game and there <em>is</em> a solid gamestate.</li><li>It\u2019s a role division kept out of inertia/tradition rather than necessity</li><li>It\u2019s a participationist game (or possibly illusionist, if it\u2019s being presented as a blorby game, but you\u2019re right, let\u2019s not assume malice and stick with participationist)</li></ul><p>Sometimes the last two points can kind of show up together. There used to be a solid game state, there isn\u2019t anymore, but there\u2019s still this role division.</p><p>I am frustrated/jarred by Burning Wheel because it whips me back &amp; forth between two different modes of play. There is so much in the game normally that puts me into the role division. Scripting my fight actions, making my character from the bottom-up in terms of life paths, hyper-diegetic skill improvement\u2026 so many things make me think \u201cOK I\u2019m the character\u201d but I always have to remember this whole other out-of-stance ability.</p><p>Could you please clarify what the difference between a participationist game and the mythic ME game is?<br/>Participationist games can have \u201cstakes questions\u201d / Kobayashi Maru moments, can\u2019t they?</p><p>I\u2019m sorry for the wonky formatting.

Not because I didn\u2019t get my way but because I thought there should have been a roll.<br/><br/>At the time I blamed all this on the system \u2018It should have been say yes or roll the dice, then I would have got my roll.\u2019<br/><br/>Now I think system is a secondary concern. For the system to even matter in the first place, me and the GM must have been onboard that this was a dramatic moment. That maybe my words would incite the citizens to violence, that we\u2019d decide it with a dice roll.<br/><br/>Whether the mob would riot is a salient point and I wanted us to be in this together in finding out what would happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite" title="AlexanderWhite"><img alt="AlexanderWhite" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite">AlexanderWhite</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485018/#Comment_485018" name="Item_355" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T06:54:57+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  6:54AM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> when you were doing full on 90's style GM stuff.

This is just checking we\u2019re on the same page about fundamentals before we get to prep/information separation. <br/><br/>Imagine two people talking, making stuff up, Bob and Sue. <br/><br/>Bob: A weary traveler<br/>Sue: staggers through a desert<br/>Bob: hungry and pained<br/>Sue: on the horizon a city<br/>and so on: of lapuzi and gold<br/>the traveler shields his eyes against the sun<br/>sees the city and smiles<br/>heads towards it<br/>within the city a callous prince reclines on a couch covered in rarest furs<br/>he rings a bell of glass to summon his favorite concubine<br/>she is there in moments, all smiles and bows<br/>but when the prince isn\u2019t looking, <br/>the faintest sneer plays over her lips<br/><br/>If they\u2019re on the same wavelength they might have generated a lot of dramatic questions.<br/>That poor concubine, what\u2019s she going to do?<br/>What\u2019s the traveler after in the city?<br/><br/>Continue play will answer these questions and generate more. This is the play to find out stuff and a method of finding out.<br/><br/>Now why not just use this method instead of any other? The inertia of tradition? Yeah for the most part. I\u2019d have a better time using the above system than say Fiasco. Is it better than Burning Wheel though?<br/><br/>Let\u2019s put Burning Wheel aside for a moment and get more fundamental. Let\u2019s ask what the player/GM division brings to the above and if we we\u2019re getting really technical, along what lines we\u2019re splitting stuff up. (Can the player make up plates, cities, callous princes?)<br/><br/>For me the rough division allows me to inhabit a character and make choices as a character, and have hopes for the character, and that\u2019s special in a way that just narrating stuff isn\u2019t. Why only play one? Well the biggest reason is because what do I do if two characters I own interact?<br/><br/>So that\u2019s a case for \u2018only play one character\u2019 and \u2018gm/player\u2019 division of stuff. My previous story might also be a case for \u2018sometimes use the dice\u2019.<br/><br/>Do we agree that the above mechanics do get us emergence? They generate questions which we wants answers to and some of those questions will be decided by the player \u2018what does he do?\u2019 some will be decided by the dice in response to what a player does  \u2018what effect does his course of action have?\u2019 and some will be decided by the GM because of what NPC\u2019s do and what elements are brought into the sis in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485020/#Comment_485020" name="Item_357" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T08:07:38+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  8:07AM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite" rel="nofollow">AlexanderWhite</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Let\u2019s say we\u2019re playing Feng Shui and our characters are in a kitchen fighting bad guys.

I saw myself as a story teller, movie director. It was almost all improvised but I was the one spinning the yarn, wanting to surprise &amp; entertain &amp; impress them. I'd sometimes go like "OK, and now we enter your apartment... let's hear what you have in there" and have them describe their own apartment and be amused by that. That does not qualify. So I get why peeps might be "oh, she didn't play 90s style the right way", I'll add: <i>Buuut...</i><br/><br/><b>Later when I was looking for "rules"</b> just prior to mirror story<br/>Yes, my goal at this point was to reach some sorta meaningful "play to find out".

But we have some commentators saying they don\u2019t even believe vegetable soup or fruit punch can even exist.</p><p>Shimrod, you brought up the traditional technique of information separation. Of havign a GM role while the players are having their characters make actions in the game world.</p><p>But when there\u2019s quantum raiders/traders in the west, or a quantum duchess/butler/priest holding that garrotte\u2026 isn\u2019t it utterly meaningless. I played this way for many years. And I just can\u2019t.</p><p>Obv the challenge element of trying to guess what number you\u2019re thinking of breaks down if you\u2019re not <em>really</em> thinking of a number, you\u2019ll just say \u201cno\u201d until we\u2019ve said 99 random numbers and then say yes on whatever number is the very last one.</p><p>But it\u2019s not just the challenge element. It\u2019s also the discovery element. \u201cExploration\u201d in the three pillars sense, not the GNS sense. We open the lid and what do we find? Turns out there\u2019s nothing there. Because you are just making things up.</p><p>It\u2019s also the story or drama element. Our characters want to make meaningful consequences but we can\u2019t do that because everywhere we turn there\u2019s just smoke and mirrors. We are ghosts, we are shadows.</p><p>Sure, we can turn to each other, collide with each other, which I\u2019ve acknowledged above. At least we know that our <em>selves</em> are solid. A drama game just needs the four walls and each other\u2019s faces to stare coldly into. Full Blorb in 5 seconds of prep \u201cwall wall wall wall table chair chair go\u201d. Awesome games have been had.</p><p>But that\u2019s not what you\u2019re talking about with your [raider|trader] west and your [duchess|butler|priest] murderer. You\u2019re asking us to get hyped up about discovering / exploring / not knowing / finding out something when there <em>is</em> nothing to discover, explore, wonder about, or find out.</p><p>\u201cBut Sandra\u201d, everyone says, \u201cthere are awesome <em>stories</em> to be told about someone travelling west or someone investigating a murderer and we can tell those stories with much less work by just improvising it all! <strong>And</strong> those stories will me much better and tighter than flailing around in the blorb!\u201d. <strong>YES.</strong> But the traditional techniques both set up the wrong expectations, and they are a waste, they get in the way of taking advantage of all the creativity you have around that table. Play Lovecraftesque, play Nerver av st\xe5l, play any of a bunch of games that work with this goal.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485038/#Comment_485038" name="Item_372" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T15:00:25+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  3:00PM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It isn't just a matter of being a lot less work.<br/><br/>It's also a matter of GM burnout. <br/><br/>Fully Blorby ( I hate that word, a lot) play requires an enormous commitment of time and energy for the GM, even if they are only using pre-made material and appropriate random charts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485041/#Comment_485041" name="Item_373" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T15:10:55+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  3:10PM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob" rel="nofollow">komradebob</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I hate that word, a lot</p></div></blockquote>\nI think I should take another break from S-G.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob" rel="nofollow">komradebob</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>It isn't just a matter of being a lot less work.<br/><br/>It's also a matter of GM burnout. <br/><br/>Fully Blorby ( I hate that word, a lot) play requires an enormous commitment of time and energy for the GM, even if they are only using pre-made material and appropriate random charts.</p></div></blockquote>\nI want to teach it and make it easier.

I don't think Trad techniques are necessarily good when you're trying to do something far different.<br/><br/>As far as Blorb itself, have you asked yourself in a serious way how far you are willing to go for that and why?<br/><br/>To me, a lot of this seems like a mental exercise somewhat removed from the implications of it's deployment in practice.<br/><br/>For example, I could see someone willing to commit to designing for and GMing bloboriffic play for one relatively self-contained "adventure" ( however may sessions, but a relatively small number).<br/><br/>I could see a sequel, or two, with significant time in between playing them ( it takes time to create that level of blorbiness, even employing random charts appropriate to the setting).<br/><br/>What I have a hard time imagining is a single GM committing to doing this long-term with real fidelity and neutrality with a consistent group of players.<br/><br/><br/>You've said you want to play a character in this style of game. Would you consistently, perhaps for years, commit to doing it as GM for other people? Could you foresee doing it without slipping into some of the bad ( not-very-blorby) habits you're against?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485044/#Comment_485044" name="Item_375" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T15:43:24+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  3:43PM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as we know, Sandra does, indeed, do just that on a regular basis (sometimes more than one session a week!).

I don't want a "funnel" type structure, I want them to be able to go pretty much anywhere. The Lost Mines of Phandelver was good, as was B4 The Lost City, and Curse of Strahd. The castle is right there on the hill, or you can go explore the country side and there is <i>plenty</i> there. I placed the Deep Carbon Observatory and Carrowmore in Barovia.<br/><br/>We've been doing a jungle hex crawl (with a couple of dungeon here and there on that hexmap) for the last year and change, and are in a big dungeon now.<br/><br/>I had an idea a while back that I haven't really tried out yet that would be sort of a compromise between creating the entire country in advance, which is what I would've <i>wanted</i> to do a la <a href="https://batintheattic.blogspot.com/2009/08/how-to-make-fantasy-sandbox.html" rel="nofollow">this overly ambituous setup</a>, but I've never been able to actually do that, between that overly ambitious methond vs the "create each hex randomly as we go along" method which I think is not solid enough.<br/><br/>That compromise is the <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/the_quest_queue/" rel="nofollow">quest queue</a>. That blog post is just a sketch, it needs some more codifying (exact distances per tier primarily). That way I could create new modules (using random generators online, using my own homebrew stuff, using finished modules from other people [both from WotC and from third party]) without quantuming them them or forcing them, just placing them on the quest queue. I haven't really tried it because a lot of the time I use modules where there is a lot of stuff already. A big region + a buncha dungeons.<br/><br/>I used the big region map from the railroaded adventure "Corsairs of the Great Sea" and let them loose using it as a sandbox, I had placed a buncha the Yawning Portal dungeons nearby too, but they also did explore one of the sites from that railroaded adventure. I let the factions and agendas from the railroaded adventure be true, I just threw out the timeline; just used the starting situation.<br/><br/>I experimented with "an island rises from the bottom of the sea" to change it from scripted ("when the characters reach this or that level") to be a daily die roll. "Did the island rise today" But that experiment, well, the campaign ended before that happened.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485050/#Comment_485050" name="Item_381" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T16:25:08+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  4:25PM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just get the starter set and run it blorbily and then build from there.\u2665<br/>That's what I did.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485052/#Comment_485052" name="Item_382" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T16:37:00+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  4:37PM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2019 4:37PM by Paul_T.">edited June 3</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oddly enough, I think the \u201cendless prep\u201d problem, while real, is kind of a red herring in this thread.<br/><br/>However - and this is the odd part! - once we understand how to determine \u201csaliency\u201d this whole problem goes away and we can have any mixture of blorb and non-blorb that we want.

There are two different old TSR RPGs from the '80s that I'd like very much to run like you're suggesting.

Each time, it led me to improvise on the spot, something that would seem to fly directly in the face of world consistency and pre-existence.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485056/#Comment_485056" name="Item_384" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T17:12:26+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  5:12PM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob" rel="nofollow">komradebob</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>What do you do to confine play within an area to allow better blorbiness?

There are some things that are nailed down, even if they remain off-screen for the time being. Typically, for example, stats of major NPCs, locations of major cities or dungeons, maybe the stats for a certain magic item. Parts of the backstory / secret history of the world. (There's even a special reward in BW for getting invested in the GM's hard-prepped stuff, the Deeds point.)<br/><br/>The thing you're missing about BW is because of your failure to consider the possibility of a fourth way.<br/><br/>-It isn't aiming for 90's style trad illusionist bullshit.<br/><br/>-It isn't aiming for "pure" story-game, where we are all 100% collaborating together to build the world and the events.<br/><br/>-It isn't aiming for blorb.<br/><br/>The thing BW is aiming for necessitates some mix of hard-prepped and improvised setting elements. I think maybe "Dramatic Protagonism" or something is a good name for it.<br/><br/>Think of it this way: to a vegetarian, you shouldn't put even a small amount of grilled hamburger meat in the meal. But to a non-vegetarian, it's perfectly fine to mix meat and vegetables to achieve whatever it is you *are* aiming for in that meal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485060/#Comment_485060" name="Item_387" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T17:30:26+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  5:30PM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob" rel="nofollow">komradebob</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>What do you do to confine play within an area to allow better blorbiness?

For our Curse of Strahd campaign I had decided that the campaign would end when Strahd died. (It took a bunch of PC parties dying before that happened.) I pitched it to the players as less of a funnel, and more of a\u2026 there are a hundred loaded rat traps in this dark room. One of them is red.

Assume the GM has created a small keep as an encounter, complete with some memorable NPCs and a few adventure hooks. If the GM has already told the players the keep is along the left road, or given them a map showing the keep on the left road, then in the game world that\u2019s where the keep is. If they choose to travel the road on the right, there is no logically consistent way they will arrive at the keep.<br/>However, if the keep was not previously mentioned, the GM can place it along whichever road the party chooses to travel \u2013 if they go left, it\u2019s along the left road; if they go right, it\u2019s along the right road \u2013 and as far as the game world (and the players) are concerned, that\u2019s where it has always been. Similarly, the keep the GM created doesn\u2019t have to be a keep. If the party knows the keep is along the left road, and they choose to travel the right road, perhaps they eventually come upon a cross- roads inn, where many of the same NPCs and adventure hooks from the keep now reside.<br/>To some, this may seem somehow sneaky or underhanded. However, enjoying an RPG is about the willing suspension of disbelief \u2013 players want to lose themselves in an imaginary world for a time, pretending to be a fictional character. As long as the wires behind the scenes, holding the sets together, don\u2019t intrude into the game, most players don\u2019t care much about how they get to the fun. They just care about getting there.</p></blockquote><p>To which I say\u2026 <strong>why is there even a fork in the road then?</strong></p><p>Even sandbox hero Kevin Crawford has \u201cyou should have a bunch of prepared sites in your folder to pull out\u201d and I\u2019m like, uh, I\u2019m not so sure that\u2019s legit.</p><p>I always want to move all content \u201cthrough the gloracle\u201d somehow.</p><p>I\u2019d rather put the keep on the random encounter table than to \u201cforce\u201d the players to visit it using those tricks.</p><p>In my game though, almost all sites are fixed to the map rather than reside on the encounter table. I\u2019d rather try something like the \u201c<a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/the_quest_queue/" rel="nofollow">The Quest Queue</a>\u201d if I wanted to place content randomly because of the idea put forth there: information=agency.</p><p>That said, I normally just use a map that have locations hard placed already. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s hard to have a bunch of dungeons placed around a town\u2026? I don\u2019t have to be super familiar with the dungeons before the players go there. Just skim through them.</p><h2 id="when-is-it-legitimate-to-reuse-unexplored-content">When is it legitimate to reuse unexplored content?</h2><p>If it\u2019s a new campaign. If the players didn\u2019t even <em>hear</em> of the site, it\u2019s fine to just copy it over to a new location on the new campaign. If they heard about it but rejected it (maybe because they didn\u2019t have time to go there, or because they didn\u2019t want to go there, or they tried going there but didn\u2019t like being there), then I ask them. That was the case in our first aQ campaign, I had placed B4 The Lost City and The Caverns of Thracia near the city of Mahabba and also generated a bunch of city stuff in there and smaller dungeons in the city, some homebrew, some stuff out of Red Tide and from a random city book. The players briefly visited the Caverns of Thracia (and lost a couple of PCs there) but decided to concentrate on the Lost City which to them was more interesting [because it was a more newly opened up area diegetically, I had decided that \u201ca pyramid had been uncovered in a sandstorm\u201d whether the Caverns of Thracia was more \u201cmeh it\u2019s been there for a while\u201d in their estimation] and also they had just had a bunch of deaths in the Caverns of Thracia.</p><p>So when I later wanted to place the Caverns of Thracia in another campaign, I asked them (ooc) for permission to do so. [In the end that campaign hasn\u2019t started yet.]</p><p>If you\u2019re still in the same campaign, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s legit. The players might still go there later. They might still go back to that left fork and go see that keep, in the GURPS example.</p><p>The \u201cTomb of Annihilation\u201d module is a hexmap that\u2019s kinda sparsely populated. It says \u201cFeel free to move areas around so that they get in your players path\u201d and I was like \u201cnuh-uh, that\u2019s against our table\u2019s social contract\u201d and stuck with their listed locations. (With one example: I decided (for myself, this wasn\u2019t something I ran by the players) that IF the characters got dragged off to a goblin village, I\u2019d use the \u201cgoblin village\u201d location and move it, letting it stand in for \u201ca generic goblin village\u201d and change the name. Them getting dragged off to a goblin village, or even them stalking some goblins home to their village, felt kinda unlikely to happen and they were more likely to stumble over the real location of that particular village.

How does that sound?<br/><br/>Ok:<br/><br/>The basis of this thread is the idea that doing Narrativism (for the sake of this thread, I think this can be treated as "rpg play with an interest in an exciting story we all get invested in, as its main priority") with traditional techniques (which may or may not include blorb; not sure on that one) is a bad idea.<br/><br/>Is that a fair summation of your thesis here?<br/><br/>Now, given that, here are the arguments I think you've made in this thread:<br/><br/>1. Using traditional techniques sends the wrong expectations to the players, who may assume that "blorby" methods are being used in the game.<br/><br/>Breaking that expectation can harm the game and/or people's enjoyment of it.<br/><br/>2. Therefore, if you're playing a Narrativist game, you should make it crystal clear that it's not "blorby", and, furthermore, you should do that by avoiding traditional techniques.<br/><br/>3. You've outlined five "pillars" of traditional, blorby play, and you feel that they go well together, support each other, and create a whole that's coherent and strong and solid.<br/><br/>Is that a fair summary?

Once triggered (players interact or choose to not interact with a location), it starts living its own life, which breaks the railroads quite effectively and creates new content for play, too.\n<blockquote><br/>How does it work with, say, a science fiction genres, as opposed to fantasy genre, where you're dealing with the issue on a multi-planet, planet-wide scale?<br/></blockquote>\nYou ask the players what they are planning to do and prep based on that. Have good random tables or develop them in play. It would be more challenging, but I do believe there is a fair amount of pre-written scifi content already available. If you go for more fantastic scifi, then there is Star wars and Starfinder (scifi Pathfinder); with harder scifi, there might be stuff for Traveller and probably some Star frontiers things would also work. Then there are all possible movies and computer games - Starcraft campaign scenarios would give fine pieces of overland maps, for example. Some locations/space ships in Alien movies could be used.\n<blockquote><br/>How do you avoid playing into your players' interests in the name of a consistent world?<br/></blockquote>\nBy using random tables, thinking how likely things would be and rolling dice, and by having a varied set of players.\n<blockquote><br/>And, while I can see a single person committing to it as designer/GM, I just don't see how that works out well in the long-term for that person, nor do I see how it encourages anyone else to take up that same level of commitment.<br/></blockquote>\nI have been running a sandbox world for several years now; sometimes with different rules systems, sometimes at cons. I have moved twice, and occasionally still run a game for the people in the city and country where I started the campaign/world.<br/><br/>Many parts of the game world are quite familiar and have layers of history.\n<blockquote><br/> What do you do to confine play within an area to allow better blorbiness?

On the other hand, my impression was that 2097 was going for something even more solid than that, with much more pre-game prep than that, which is what has been confusing me while watching this conversation.<br/><br/><br/>2) This next part is possibly a bad derail, but I'm trying to figure out how I'd make 2097's on-steroids version of pre-game prep work with either Boot Hill or Gangbusters, two of my old-timey favorite TSR games.

I just had a nice idea that a certain assassin the player characters hurt might send a message back, probably with a poison. It would fit their nature. But then: Would they have access to such a poison? No, their equipment has been defined. Could they manufacture some kind of poison? Possibly. so I set up probabilities and roll a die.<br/><br/>The idea that they might use poison was one of these spontaneous ideas. They could just as well slipped away silently, for example, never to be heard from again. That is what another bad guy is planning to do, for example. I do not start second-guessing each such decision.\n<blockquote><br/>2) This next part is possibly a bad derail, but I'm trying to figure out how I'd make 2097's on-steroids version of pre-game prep work with either Boot Hill or Gangbusters, two of my old-timey favorite TSR games. Both of them have rather nice, simple setting modules for them, but both have larger adventure modules that I have a hard time envisioning working with anything like an explore in any direction set up, at any time.

Use something like reaction rolls to determine who are friendly and who not. Turn scripted events into random ones; roll when the invaders land and start their attack, either by making it an encounter table entry or adding a separate larger scale event table, or just saying it happens in d20 months.<br/><br/>If the adventure has all the events focused on the scripted path the players take, you might want to add more content to other places on the map, too.<br/><br/>You are grabbing locations, monsters, NPC:s, and the setting from the adventure, not the plot. For some adventures it might not be worth it to do this; you would gain too little and throw away too much. In that case, find a better adventure or source to mine.<br/><br/>I am not familiar with Boot hill or Gangbusters. For a western, I would imagine that many D&amp;D villages would be fine, since they always have general stores and other western colour.<br/><br/>If Gangbusters is more urban, then you might want to find as a good a map of the city as possible. Maybe get some inspiration, or at least a review of existing technology, from Alexandrian's writing on urban adventuring: <a href="https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/36473/roleplaying-games/thinking-about-urbancrawls" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/36473/roleplaying-games/thinking-about-urbancrawls</a> (a long series)<br/><br/>Non-player characters with lists of goals, personality and resources at hand might be the most useful kind of prep, there. The "resources at hand" is often missing from or mostly handwaved in character drama games, but if the game has a challenge dimension, then it is vital.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485221/#Comment_485221" name="Item_429" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-04T15:03:14+00:00" title="June  4, 2019  3:03PM">3:03PM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my actual practice that's how I'd run the poison guy too.

OTOH, some of them are a bit more locally focused and time-line-ish too.<br/><br/>The Gangbusters modules are mysteries* with timelines. That's where things get a bit trickier. Without those modules or something similar, PIs, Plain clothes Division Detectves, and Reporters have little to nothing to do.<br/><br/>Decent mysteries emulating  classic styles of books and film can certainly be tricky to do, especially ones with commitment to prep, so those modules are god sends.<br/><br/>*Well, okay, the modules after <b>GB1: Trouble Brewing</b>, which is a setting module (with a nice fictional city that ties to the maps in the boxed set) and a series of events meant to set up a power vacuum in the local underworld. All the stuff in the first one could easily be expanded into a decent sand box. <br/><br/><br/>[Total side note: I kinda want to create a tool called the " Wait, so why is everybody else acting all mysterious then ?!?!" Worksheet. Any given mystery is actually pretty straight forward. It's just that absolutely everyone else involved is trying to hide their own personal, possibly criminal but unrelated, dirt that they muddy everything up. Or, they try to cover for someone else they think is dirty. Whatever.
