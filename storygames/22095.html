This is common but I just Do Not Want. I don't have any problems with a game like Fiasco or <i>Nerver av st\xe5l</i> or Microscope. When those kinds of games appeared I thought they were cool.<br/><br/>Playing "Pathfinder with bangs" I think is bull. Adding bangs to a traditional game\u2014and I'd argue that's what Sorcerer does/is\u2014is something that does not sit well with me.<br/><br/>To me the pre-writing / frustrated author GMing style (story "before": gnusto) works best with a game set up around it (like Chuubo's if you want the players to write stories [which is cool], or something like Dread or some shit like that if you want the GM to write stories) and the story NOW (nitfol) goal works best with a game using completely alien &amp; non-traditional techniques.<br/><br/>And by "works best" I don't mean more effective. Not at all. What I do mean is that it's least likely to undermine the glory of blorb and the blorbiness of the gloracle.<br/><br/>Let me try another way: no-one is going to think the GM is railroading you in Microscope (also, there is no GM).<br/><br/>So I'm <i>not</i> saying that most narrativist games are using alien techniques. I am saying that story games that use alien techniques (typically but not necessarily GM-less being one of those techniques) are less threatening to me as a devotee of blorb.<br/><br/>With that said, finding which nitfol techniques work well <i>with</i> blorb without undermining it can enhance a blorb game a lot. There's nothing wrong with giving a couple of opportunities for Addressing some Premise in the sandbox <i>as long as it doesn't come at the expense of the sandbox</i>. It's actually a really nice mix.<br/><br/>The trick to doing two things at once is to decide which of the things matter the most to you and accept that the other thing is compromised. For example, putting mittens on while running down the stairs requires me to keep stair running in my mind in a way that I wouldn't have to do if I wasn't also putting mittens on. Just running down the stairs I don't have to think at all, the body just does it automatically. But also putting mittens, I have to be accepting of the fact that there's an occasional gap or fumble in the mittens-pulling-on because I sure as heckfire don't want there to be one in the stairs-down-running.<br/><br/>And I don't want there to be a compromise in the integrity of blorb.<br/><br/>So for me a super weird &amp; alien game like Fiasco, Microscope, the Skeletons\u2026 they stay so far away from blorb (no risk of falling in stairs) so I feel safe with them. A game like Sorcerer on the other hand is like "nooo you're gonna trip &amp; hurt yourself!".<br/><br/>Unless you take care and <b>move all bang-like-stuff through the "sandboxifying queue"</b> that is rolltables &amp; map keys, make them less scripted and more part of the organic world (handing responsibility of introducing them over to the gloracle)\u2014and make them something that the hobos might miss or that maybe don't happen. An example of a fail is in my beloved <i>Lost Mine of Phandelver</i> which is <i>almost</i> the perfect adventure but there is one room where someone is "juuuust about to get killed when the hobos arrive" \u2014 rereading the adventure right now, the room description looks innocuous and not "time-sensitive" (the guy is just beaten up &amp; is being interrogated) but my players somehow got the impression that the moment was "scripted" and it wasn't well received therefore. "Deep Carbon Observatory" has this problem too, which is unfair to it; the event generator system for the very first part flows SO naturally into each other, and the choices the players make are so seamlessly integrated, that it feels completely scripted and that there were never any choices in the first place, making it feel like a completely railroaded &amp; therefore crappy sequence. So those are some pitfalls you have to watch out for when working with the bane of all sandbox: "events".<br/><br/>The random rumor table is a very valuable tool to place things like this on.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484117/#Comment_484117" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-24T08:37:49+00:00" title="May 24, 2019  8:37AM">May 24</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2019 8:39AM by Rafu.">edited May 24</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Amen to that.<br/><br/>You seem to be rejecting what used to be called "vanilla narrativism" on the Forge a million years ago, and I'm fine with that. "Vanilla narr" existed as an evolutionary step, and now that we've developed games with dedicated techniques there's no need to go back to that except to satisfy one's historical curiosity.<br/><br/>And I say that as someone who's quite fond of <i>Sorcerer</i>! But I don't believe I would be able to play <i>Sorcerer</i> any effectively had I not played <i>Apocalypse World</i> before, as well as read through it, it being such a good treatise on how to MC itself (that which no <i>Sorcerer</i> edition or supplement is). And I believe I "get" <i>Apocalypse World</i> thanks to having experienced more compactly designed games before that: had I come to it exclusively from playing <i>Pathfinder</i> adventure paths, who knows what I'd have read into it!<br/><br/>To introduce RPGs to new audiences, or to introduce "story now" play to more "traditional" RPG audiences, I'll keep using tightly designed games such as <i>Follow</i>, <i>Dog Eat Dog</i>, <i>Montsegur 1244</i>, <i>SKEW</i>, <i>Lovecraftesque</i> etc., thank you, and I wouldn't dream of indulging my quirky Sorcerer habit on such occasions. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><small>Actually, I do use a lot of games with a GM role for new-to-RPG audiences too: <i>Psi*Run</i>, <i>Fables of Camelot</i>, <i>On Mighty Thews</i>...

And while conventional storygaming wisdom suggests that you should jump at these opportunities because storygaming loves conflict (and maybe also because it inherits some of trad's <i>obligation to play along</i>), perhaps in proper sandbox style the actual bang is/should be the choice to engage or not, and the consequences come from that choice.<br/><br/>I don't know how much that constitutes Real Actual Narrativism though. It feels more like in-character Microscoping almost?<br/><br/>I once saw someone describe the ideal experience of being a bottom (in the sexual sense) as "getting what you want without having to ask for it." I keep coming back to that description a lot when it comes to roleplaying games. It has been my experience that there are a lot of roleplaying bottoms who hate storygaming's/narrativism's tendency to be up front about what you want to see happen, and who cluster around variations of pseudo-sandbox or SIM play or blorby games that are curated to provide a very thin slice of experience.<br/><br/>Anyways the point there (and I apologize if this is one of those things that's so blatantly obvious that nobody ever says it and I just don't realize it) is that sandbox play might not <i>really</i> be about all the procedures and the superficial descriptions of what goes on, as much as it is about that desire to get what you want without having to ask for it. All the superficial dross of the game is just there to obfuscate the workings by which someone else acknowledges that our desires are valid, to soothe the anxiety and guilt we feel over wanting things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484122/#Comment_484122" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-24T09:49:52+00:00" title="May 24, 2019  9:49AM">May 24</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" rel="nofollow">yukamichi</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I feel like a lot of the more hardcore-sandbox-purist advice already tends to acknowledge this?

Say \u201cOK, three hours pass and then there\u2019s a knock on the door\u201d, don\u2019t wait for 3 hours at the game table irl. This sounds ridiculous to people who know how to GM without making this mistake but it\u2019s a super common mistake!! If nothing happens for 3 weeks in the game then nothing happens! Just fast-forward to when something does happen.

I was talking about the Story Now kind of preparation, but even then, you can't account for all possible places your players might try to visit, even more when running for example urban games where their options aren't constrained like a dungeon or some other natural environments.<br/><br/>But leaving that aside, I don't fully buy in those "musts" about how prep must be done. It seems a very particular style of GMing prep technique that you seem to be broadly applying to games that don't fit in. Especially since you seem to not apply it to the other games you praise, like Fiasco, where every player makes things up... all the session. I know, Fiasco is GMless, but I don't think all games with GM can be dumped into the same bag, and GMs be judged according to the same principles.<br/><br/>With some Story Games, I think the purpose of having those flags defined, is that when making something on the spot, you can tie that thing to one of those flags. For example, in AW, you need to make an NPC on the spot, so you tie them to an existing front, or to an NPC or gang/group that's tied to the PCs. You're still making sth on the spot, but your improvisation is thematically linked to the important content of the campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484156/#Comment_484156" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-24T19:07:15+00:00" title="May 24, 2019  7:07PM">May 24</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The principle I read Sandra as striving for is something like diegetic coherence, implying both internal consistency among all of the made-up things about the world and the sort of asymmetric distribution of information that makes it possible for players to feel as if they are "discovering" a pre-existing world.

Do I really want to "discover" a pre-existing world when playing a story now game? How does that mingle with, for example, one use for wises in Burning Wheel, where the player may state as part of their intent a fact about the setting, and then roll to see if it's true? Or, for example, the first session (or first 2 sometimes) in Apocalypse World or Monsterhearts, where mostly the GM will ask the players for details about the scenario in order to make the fronts. <br/><br/>So, how could those games be judged by this specific expectation for GM prep, when in their rules they explicitly go against it several times? I can probably find even more examples, like Circles in BW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ebear" title="ebear"><img alt="ebear" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ebear">ebear</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484160/#Comment_484160" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-24T19:35:17+00:00" title="May 24, 2019  7:35PM">May 24</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This isn't addressed to anyone in particular. I find it helpful to talk about what we want in our games and why certain techniques support or don't support that thing. The RISS which I think 2097 is using as a basis for a lot of this discussion definitely does get into that, particularly where it points to where certain techniques step on one another's toes.<br/><br/>But at the same time I still feel like we have a lot more words for techniques than we do for experiences. Sometimes it's hard for me to express what I want from a game because I don't know it until I see it, or even if I know what it is I have a hard time expressing it to someone else.<br/><br/>It's obviously a way more subjective thing than technique but it still seems worth talking about. Here are some phrases that have helped me to understand what folks are striving for with blorby play:<br/>"Holodeck" play &lt;- This is one I've heard 2097 use<br/>"Escape room" play &lt;- Someone else on the internet talked about it this way<br/><br/>There's a particular kind of experience that I call "playing 20 questions with a doorknob" which I really like.

For example, putting mittens on while running down the stairs requires me to keep stair running in my mind in a way that I wouldn't have to do if I wasn't also putting mittens on. Just running down the stairs I don't have to think at all, the body just does it automatically. But also putting mittens, I have to be accepting of the fact that there's an occasional gap or fumble in the mittens-pulling-on because I sure as heckfire don't want there to be one in the stairs-down-running.<br/><br/>And I don't want there to be a compromise in the integrity of blorb.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nI'm super charmed by this metaphor by the way. I can think of a specific campaign where things became more and more glove focused until I ended up in a heap at the bottom of the stairs. I had to beg my group to port our game over to a more glove focused system (read "dungeon world"). I think I've mentioned that before.<br/><br/>And it goes in the other direction too. I sometimes use blorby techniques when I play Trollbabe, but in that case the stairs are the nitfol techniques and the gloves are the blorby ones...

I run Monster of the Week which is a powered by the apocalypse game pretty regularly. I have a really hard time figuring out what the priorities of that game are. But at the same time people seem to love when I run that game. It's excruciating for me though because I can't isolate what they like about it and I don't know what my role is.<br/><br/>Also last weekend I met someone who had played some Delta Green but otherwise didn't have much rpg experience. He told me he wanted to play in an illusionist game straight up, he said he wanted a game (I'm paraphrasing) "where it feels like you have a lot of options but no matter what you choose to do you end up in the right place at the right time and it's a good story". I told him it sounded like the games that I used to run when I was first starting, I called them "dinner theater" games, he said that sounded great. It broke my heart because I don't want to do that anymore. <br/><br/>I ended running Barrowmaze for him and some folks using Knave, does that make me a bad person? I think they had a good time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite" title="AlexanderWhite"><img alt="AlexanderWhite" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite">AlexanderWhite</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484178/#Comment_484178" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-24T20:59:25+00:00" title="May 24, 2019  8:59PM">May 24</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2019 9:00PM by AlexanderWhite.">edited May 24</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> <br/><br/>To tie together what you and <a href="/forums/profile/ebear">@ebear</a>  are saying.

To be clear I'm actually coming from a place of making things less burdensome for myself. For one thing when I run a blorby game I usually don't <i>make</i> the prep myself, sometimes I do, but a lot of the time I buy it. I like reading modules, it's fun for me. So for me building a sandbox is really just a matter of picking a couple of location based modules with similar tone, adding some connections between them, plopping them down a map, and filling the spaces in between. But if I'm being honest it took me a while to get there, I don't think there are really shortcuts.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Khimus" rel="nofollow">Khimus</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>To be fair, I've had some players occasionally tell me it looked like I was improvising (like, in a bad way) for a particular session.

I'm choosing to lay it at the feet of the system saying that it should be setting expectations for me. But there's probably a way of setting those expectations myself, it's just hard.

We can have sandbox design in an entirely non-traditional game, and lots (maybe most?) games using traditional techniques are definitely NOT blorb (e.g. Silmenume's "spicy dice" game).<br/><br/>I feel very safe saying that, by Sandra's standards, <i>Sorcerer</i>, <i>Apocalypse World</i>, and <i>Dungeon World</i> are not "fully blorby" games (although all can end up featuring a lot of sandboxy GM prep).<br/><br/><b><i>Ultimately, it's really about separating the techniques</i></b> (e.g. traditional mechanics, prepared sandbox, impartial resolution, player narration) <b><i>from the creative goals of play</i></b>. Almost any combination is possible with the right design.<br/><br/>(By the way, I agree that <i>Fiasco</i> is not a particularly Narrativist-supporting game. It's probably possible to get that kind of play out of it, but it certainly isn't "built in", and rarely happens, in my experience, unless everyone at the table is hardcore gunning for that anyway. It's highly non-traditional and can create great stories, but I wouldn't call it an explicitly Narrativist game, nor categorize it that way myself.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484195/#Comment_484195" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-25T06:39:29+00:00" title="May 25, 2019  6:39AM">May 25</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p></div></blockquote> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ebear" rel="nofollow">ebear</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I ended running Barrowmaze for him and some folks using Knave, does that make me a bad person?

A small town, a couple of small dungeons, some rumours, some encounter tables. When you fall back to tier three, you pat yourself on the back, pick yourself up, keep going, and before next session you patch the hole (most often by adding mechanics or tables for this kinda thing). This is a feedback loop that lets you start simple and always keep improving.</p><p>I was playing with a group of newbies a few months ago, I just grabbed the classic \u201cHoly Sword!\u201d one page dungeon and gave them some level 5 pregens. It was gonna be boardgame night and I wasn\u2019t sure if they would be into D&amp;D so I didn\u2019t want to put too much effort in. And then whatever they tried I had a rule for it. (I play Finchian trap-finding style, but plenty of things <em>are</em> rule-driven such as I\u2019ve picked up the Veins of the Earth method of setting climbing DCs.) And they were so impressed at how they could do <em>anything</em> but yet it all had rules and felt solid. Well, because I\u2019ve been in this \u201cfeedback loop\u201d of the three tiers of truth and improving over 5 years of play.</p><p>I tried to prep an ACKS sandbox according to the rules in that book and completely bounced off it. I tried rolling up a sandbox according to <a href="https://batintheattic.blogspot.com/2009/08/how-to-make-fantasy-sandbox.html" rel="nofollow">some of the more ambitious blog posts out there</a>. Completely unpossible. (I\u2019m just too lazy &amp; too busy tripping balls &amp; posting on S-G.)</p><p>Then when the 5e starter set came out, that was perfect. One flimsy little booklet of rules and one flimsy little booklet of sandbox. I see the PHB, the MM, and the DMG as \u201cexpansions\u201d to the starter set and the starter set as the core game\u2665 I was <em>terrified</em> of DMing but man I love those flimsy booklets and those blue dice\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665</p><p>Also, I need to augment the three tiers of truth principle with the \u201cwallpaper saliency\u201d principle. It\u2019s 100% fine to improvise things that are mere color. From principles &amp; a feel of the characters and world. \u201cWhat wallpaper is it in here?\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s torn, they seem to not really care about their abode.\u201d When things become salient, then you can\u2019t improvise those things anymore. For example a spell that lets you teleport through yellow surfaces. Then suddenly you might need a \u201crandom wallpaper table\u201d!</p><p>Here\u2019s an example both of the wallpaper saliency principle and of how this \u201cfeedback loop\u201d of the three tiers of truth is <em>still</em> ongoing. It\u2019s a path leading forever towards the horizon and I\u2019m <em>still</em> growing and improving as a DM. Most recently a player wanted to know if moss grew here.

So I was already in <em>love</em> with the high agency of blorby play. So when the players (I mentioned this in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/484194/#Comment_484194" rel="nofollow">the other thread just now</a> didn\u2019t enter the \u201clevel one area\u201d, I thought that was just <em>awesome</em>.

And this metaphor became a wreck!</p><p>Our second campaign I had set up at sorta family soap opera / inheritance drama with a shop that I expected the players to get to gradually know and maybe get involved in. I had also a thief that was casing the shop that I thought the players might fight. But the first thing they did was try to rob the shop!

It\u2019s a show. I have a pretty low bar for the quality of play on a show. It would be just as dumb to try to criticize the gameplay on the old Dungeons &amp; Dragons cartoon. Matthew Mercer is a great guy. SUPER cool.<br/>I\u2019ve watched maybe 20 eps or so of Critical Role; I think I\u2019m up to like ep 16 or so of the second campaign (yes I\u2019m way behind; I just don\u2019t like to watch TV when I have mental health issues, it\u2019s not a good activity for me) and I\u2019ve seen a handful of eps of first campaign.</p><p>Their use of gloriously detailed encounter areas is obv not a good idea (see above). They don\u2019t do full OSR style sandbox play but they let the dice fall where they may &amp; develop the areas where they see the player character\u2019s going. Ryley\u2019s analysis was completely off and was dumb. If I <em>were</em> to judge it, I couldn\u2019t because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in Mercer\u2019s head or behind his screen. And, again, I don\u2019t want to scare people <em>away</em> from blorb, I want to teach them so that they can <em>reach</em> blorb.</p><p>One of my players is a big crit role fan and at first they said \u201cOh, can\u2019t you do this or this or this thing more like Mercer\u201d and I said \u201cNo, I\u2019m gonna do it my style\u201d and then now, a year later, the same player said \u201cOh, I was watching crit role and it was so annoying how they did this or this or this, I wish they did it more like you\u201d and I was like\u2026 <em>yes! vindicated!</em>\u2665</p><p>Because in the end all you need to satisfy are your own group.

The reason that potentially tautological-sounding premise works in Sorcerer is because <i>everything about the design of the game</i> pushes you further and further towards answering that question in an interesting way. From the Kickers and Bangs to the very premise of the game: that you can bend reality and summon Demons to do your bidding.<br/><br/>It's no simple or small thing; it's big and, if you follow the steps of the game's process, it really gets pumped up to 11. That's not a "low bar" at all, but quite the contrary. I could see people seeing how exaggerated and central that premise becomes in Sorcerer and assuming that anything lighter and subtler must NOT qualify as Narrativism, which would be a mistake as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484216/#Comment_484216" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-25T08:22:29+00:00" title="May 25, 2019  8:22AM">May 25</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The problem is that, by doing the prep before seeing the characters, you\u2019d be erasing/removing most of the fun that Alexander is describing.

The reason that potentially tautological-sounding premise works in Sorcerer is because <i>everything about the design of the game</i> pushes you further and further towards answering that question in an interesting way. From the Kickers and Bangs to the very premise of the game: that you can bend reality and summon Demons to do your bidding.</p><p>It\u2019s no simple or small thing; it\u2019s big and, if you follow the steps of the game\u2019s process, it really gets pumped up to 11.

Occasionally, such a twist is warranted. <br/><br/>But it's a question of practicality and repeatability:<br/><br/>What if we had four or five PCs, each with a stated goal or premise, and we failed to address all of them? Keep in mind that this means that each player came to the game hoping to deal with that issue/topic/dilemma, and not a single one was actually brought out in play. Now imagine doing that over and over and over.<br/><br/>Those aren't going to be happy players.<br/><br/>It would be like sending D&amp;D adventurers into a dungeon with no monsters, no traps, and no treasure. I can imagine an unusual, single adventure where that's the case and it's still interesting... but it's not a really a sustainable model for "what you should do when your friends say they want to play D&amp;D with you". They'll be disappointed; it was only the shock value that was making it work in the first place - working against expectations. Once those are no longer the expectations, the "trick" doesn't work anymore.<br/><br/>The D&amp;D players want to fight monsters and collect treasure. Max the thief wants there to be an orphanage, the potential for finding gold, and some scary stuff that he must decide whether to face or not.

Thanks for the advice, I guess, Sandra, but I disagree with plenty of it. I'm currently GMing BW and can't imagine how a table might improve it more than brainstorming with the BITs in mind prior to the session, for example. In fact, I don't fully accept that principle of random generated content &gt; improvised content, the whole thing seems an alien creature imposed over a game that doesn't fit into that school of GMing.<br/>I'll be GMing SwN some day, but again I don't buy that blorb somehow is the standard by which every GMed game must be judged. Seems to me like criticising D&amp;D for not supporting story now play, like we somehow devolved into "these games must ALL do/have X, Y and Z, regardless of their goals", which is a very backwards mindset.\n<blockquote>Very true! However, in a Narrativist game, the desire for blorbiness would be *very low*, so it's unlikely to be a sticking point for anyone. (More to the point, if I'm running a Narrativist game, I'm not going to set up any false expectations of blorbiness.)</blockquote>\nThanks.<br/>My experience with story now games is that they tend to be a bit weak while the scenario is being built, and pretty intense afterwards. Some players don't like those first sessions, other ones actively collaborate into it. As usual, it's not an agenda for everybody, the same way not everybody wants to play a sandbox.<br/><br/>To comment on other things written in this thread, how'd a story now game behave if the scenario was created by the GM before even the PCs were, as Sandra prefers? In Torchbearer and BitD (is BitD story now?), I've found it works mostly alright, if the dungeon in the first case is used as a half painted canvas that's completed with BIG related content.<br/>For Apocalypse World or BW? Not so much, unless even the PCs are pre generated, and the players agree to play that scenario (like a one shot, for example).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite" title="AlexanderWhite"><img alt="AlexanderWhite" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite">AlexanderWhite</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484244/#Comment_484244" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-25T16:02:23+00:00" title="May 25, 2019  4:02PM">May 25</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Khimus" rel="nofollow">Khimus</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Ok.

I make a thief charlatan. <br/><br/>I choose a few things from the charlatan TIBF list.<br/><br/>Scam: I put on new identities like clothes. <br/>(T) I lie about almost everything, even where\u2019s no good reason too. <br/>(I) I never target people who can\u2019t afford to lose a few coins. <br/>(B) A powerful person killed someone I love, someday soon I\u2019ll have my revenge. <br/>(F) I can\u2019t resists a pretty face.<br/><br/>Now that\u2019s not great for Narrativist play. We need to tweak stuff before we start. We want a kicker/inciting incident. Related to the (B) seems strongest. So we\u2019ll start by creating the powerful person and what the kicker is. We need to make it urgent, so let\u2019s say it\u2019s a Prince and I\u2019ve learnt that he\u2019s on a diplomatic mission for two weeks, somewhere close. He\u2019ll be less well guarded than when he\u2019s at his palace at home.<br/><br/>That\u2019s strong but now we need an actual personality. (T) is weak. No good reason? that\u2019s bullshit. We need to rewrite. I lie about almost everything because if people knew the real me they would use it against me (people are mostly scum).<br/><br/>That plays into the (I) in an interesting way as well. People might be mostly scum but I\u2019m not.<br/><br/>I also use my lies to get pretty people into bed with me. That says something interesting about how my character views sex and love. Oh, but my lover was killed (B), maybe he was the only person I could be honest with. <br/><br/>So that sounds like a good character. We begin play, the GM has no prep.<br/><br/>The starting situation is that I\u2019m broke and I live in a large city<br/><br/>Very first thing the GM asks: <br/><br/>GM: What do you do?<br/><br/>Player: I\u2019m going to run a confidence game on one of the nobles. I need that money and I need it quick, to get my revenge. Yet they need to be able to loose a few coin. So I\u2019m going to scout out my contacts, ask around, find someone I\u2019d be comfortable conning out of their cash.<br/><br/>GM: (notices a good opportunity for a roll) ok I\u2019ll roll your trait in secret and record the result.  (The GM rolls and it\u2019s a failure. He decides the charlatan will find someone who appears they can lose a few coin, but on deeper inspection they can\u2019t)<br/><br/>At this point the player go back and forth describing the con and all that good stuff. It takes maybe a week to set up and we get to know the various characters more. Then this happens:<br/><br/>GM as the Noble: I really hope this scheme works.

You seem to want to paint everything in terms of "good" and "bad", which makes it difficult to have these discussions, but I'd encourage you to get away from value judgements and just look at what's happening dispassionately. I'm not trying to saying anything is good or bad; just <i>to formulate a good description of what's happening</i>.<br/><br/>It seems to me that <i>Critical Role</i> is a good exemplar, because you and I are both familiar with it, it can be referenced specifically (down to particular moments of play!), and Mercer has made videos explaining what he's doing. (Not in great depth, in my opinion, but there are some clues there as to how he's running the game.)<br/><br/>You've said that "narrativism is bullshit when used with traditional techniques", and that, therefore, you only like it or accept it (?) in a game which is so obviously non-traditional that "blorb" qualities and techniques couldn't possibly be relevant (e.g. <i>Fiasco</i> is a single session game with no GM and no possibility for prep).<br/><br/>I'd like to posit that some non-zero portion of <i>Critical Role</i> (and, arguably, many of the best/most memorable/touching moments) are Narrativist, or at least look similar enough to Narrativism that we can use them as an example.<br/><br/>Clearly, I think:<br/><br/>* <i>At least some</i> bits of play are hitting a potential Narrativist payoff.<br/>* The techniques of play, as well as the mechanics, are entirely traditional.<br/>* [Slightly more debatable] The game isn't being run according to "blorb" principles (or, at least, not to Sandra standards, nor mine).<br/><br/><i>[EDIT: Replaced the character names from the below with made-up names to protect the spoiler-sensitive.]<br/></i><br/>If we accept at least the two first premises above, can we imagine a version of <i>Critical Role</i> that is entirely focused on the sort of emotional payoff that occurs in premise-heavy moments? Where those high emotional stakes moments are the thing that all the participants are trying to create and pursue? "Gundarf defeats the Evil Duke, but doesn't kill his sister, giving her freedom and forgiveness despite her betrayal of the family"... or this quote from a commenter: "Each of those moments were emotional and powerful, but...this moment was beyond words. I couldn't agree more with Colville, Frobdug's decision was the climax of the story, and I was tearing up alongside Sam" - and THAT is why everyone involved in the game is coming to the table every week. It doesn't seem like a stretch to me.<br/><br/>In that hypothetical game (I don't want to assume anything about how the players <i>actually</i> feel about their real, actual game), we would have a Narrativist agenda being pursued with entirely traditional techniques. All the participants seem to be enjoying every bit of it, as well. In what way would that be "bullshit"? Where would you see the breakdown (or potential breakdown)?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484260/#Comment_484260" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-25T20:37:45+00:00" title="May 25, 2019  8:37PM">May 25</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's worth revisiting Ron Edwards' take on this, in the essay "Setting and Emergent Stories."

Can we imagine a game that's very much *like* Critical Role, but with different people involved and, perhaps, more clarity on the Narrativist angle, and discuss that? It really isn't about the specifics of Critical Role, but about the exemplar of a game run with traditional techniques which could pursue a Narrativist agenda, which you seem to be really against but refuse to tell us why or how it could be a problem.<br/><br/>I'll edit out the spoilers, though; that's a good idea.<br/><br/>As for the Colbert video, it has nothing to do with this thread, but I'll make it easy for you - I think you'll find it interesting example for your "remapping" interest - watch from 15:00 exactly to 18:00.

Each game design (and I'm including GM tools like this in the idea of the "System" operating at the table) will make different choices and prioritize different things.<br/><br/>In Narrativism-supporting designs, in particular, the dice are often used to create opportunities for the players to pursue their characters' goals (and to prevent other players, like the GM, from simply refusing those). In AW, for instance, the design of the moves allows for a chance of success in various fictional situations that a bad GM might otherwise refuse; the effects of that on long-term play are quite dramatic.<br/><br/>I remember many years ago someone asked if it was even possible to write a Narrativist "adventure", since the story was supposed to evolve in play. (At that point in time, there was no "OSR movement", and so pretty much all the "written adventures" people we familiar with had a linear progression from one scene to the next - that was the state of the art and the industry standard.)<br/><br/>So, how would you make a Narrativist scenario, without pre-determining what the story would be?<br/><br/>No one had done that yet, so someone decided to step and produce an example. I believe it was called "Well of Souls", and it was formatted as a relationship map, with each NPC having different desires and goals. There were two important nobles who could have been responsible for a death (I think it was a death; something significant and dramatic, anyway) at the heart of the scenario.<br/><br/>The GM was instructed to follow the flow of play and see what was going on, and then react accordingly by having her NPCs act and react to developing events: "once the game starts, simply play your NPCs!"<br/><br/>Then the scenario did something really weird: <i>it didn't tell you which of the two was responsible</i>. <br/><br/>I thought this was incredibly bizarre. What's the point of writing a detailed, in-depth scenario, and then leaving out the most important piece?!? It was so jarring.<br/><br/>They then explained that, as you played, you could eventually reveal that whichever of the two was the most interesting/emotionally nuanced character was responsible for the murder.<br/><br/>This was a new and very different approach to prepping for a game I'd never encountered before. It's a very interesting technique!<br/><br/>It was quite a mind-expanding exercise to try to wrap my mind around this "heretical" approach to prepping a scenario.<br/><br/>I generally prefer to have things settled beforehand (a la blorb), but sometimes this can be just the ticket (e.g. I determine that someone is poisoning the well in the village in session 1 - maybe because a player authored that detail, and we'll figure out who did it later, in prep for session 4).<br/><br/>In any case, I would never simply write off such a tool, instead adding it to my bag of tricks: for some people, it might be just the thing they prefer. For some game designs, it may be just the thing (because it's a one shot and no one preps). For some play situations, it might be perfect. And if some people out there are having fun playing with such a tool, who am I to tell them that they're doing it wrong? That makes no sense to me. Unlike, say, railroading, I see no bad social ramifications or broken promises nor the potential to ruin the game in any way.<br/><br/>Some game designs will demand this in places, as well. Particularly in games where authorship is distributed in various ways (whether subtly or not soo subtly), it is either impossible or undesirable to prep particular material. Likewise, in other designs, the room to prep something explicitly might be *right there*, despite the other features of the game:<br/><br/>As the opposite experience, we recently played <i>Witch</i>. That game is heavily improvised and collaborative, GMless, with no 'traditional' techniques at all. However, the player of the Witch is instructed to write down the guilt or innocence of the Witch at the beginning of the story and then to seal their choice in an envelope.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the envelope is opened and we find out the truth. That, in turn, informs the endgame and the eventual fates of the characters. It's a lovely use of a "blorb" technique in one of the least "blorby" games ever written! And it works perfectly in that context; take that away and <i>Witch</i> would be a far poorer game.<br/><br/>I'm all for experimenting with such hybrids and crossovers and picking the tool you need at the right time.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" rel="nofollow">EmmatheExcrucian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I wholesale agree with Sandra about narrativism not working at all when used with traditional techniques. It makes for incoherent play. </p></div></blockquote>\nI think that playing in a Narrativist style with entirely traditional techniques can be really difficult, awkward, and can very easily produce incoherent play. You're absolutely right.<br/><br/>However, to say that it "doesnt' work at all" or never works is foolish; you'd have to conclude that Narrativist play <i>didn't exist at all until 10 or 15 years ago</i>. <br/><br/>This is a silly proposition, since people have doing it since the inception of the hobby (and the concept of Narrativism was invented to describe a kind of play they were already doing, not some hypothetical thing to try in the future).<br/><br/>More importantly, that ignores the reality of the matter, which is that there is a spectrum of techniques and application such that any game can have a mixture of traditional and non-traditional techniques; Sandra's game has Hillfolk mechanics in it, Deliverator's D&amp;D game includes story game-like 'TIBFs' and Dungeon World-derived XP mechanics, etc, etc. This conversation started in the first placebecause Sandra was explaining her disinterest or dislike for Sorcerer, due to its traditional design. That game is clearly non-traditional enough that it got labeled a "story game" when it was written by many, though! (I also dislike some overly traditional aspects of Sorcerer, but I would never say it's "bullshit" or "makes for incoherent play" when so many people have had tremendously enjoyable play with those rules (see the links I posted in the "things to read on Story Games thread"; and a bunch of us here on Story Games just played Sorcerer for the first time last year and had a great time with it.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484275/#Comment_484275" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-25T22:12:00+00:00" title="May 25, 2019 10:12PM">May 25</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 25, 2019 10:41PM by Paul_T.">edited May 25</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>They are awesome for a narrativist game.<br/><br/>That's why I'm encouraging narrativists to go blorb but if they do, to go <i>wholly</i> blorb or else they'll have incoherence.<br/><br/>If addressing the premise is your <i>NUMBER ONE GOAL</i> then you might run in into trouble if that makes you want to compromise blorb.

I don't understand how you can make all those statements in the same post. To the point of being completely lost, frankly.<br/><br/>Are Narrativism and "blorb" opposites in your mind, and mutually exclusive? <br/><br/>If so, you're asking "Narrativists" to stop playing the way they like and to switch to a different playstyle (since going "full blorb" is going to replace their primary creative goal).<br/><br/>If they are not opposites, but, instead, can support each other, then why this thread? Isn't your whole point that they are incompatible here ("bullshit", more specifically)?<br/><br/>(Or are you separating "blorb" and "traditional techniques" into completely different corners, and expecting "Narrativists" to adopt blorb but stay away from "traditional techniques"? That sounds odd, as well.)<br/><br/><br/>EDIT: Rereading your post, it makes a little more sense than it did at first. However, there is still the issue that the very definition of "Narrativist" is that "addressing premise is YOUR NUMBER ONE GOAL", and your advice to that person is make it no longer your number one goal. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I'm not sure what to do with that, nor have you explained why there might be incoherence if they do so.

How would the game be different if, in every one of those cases, you rolled, instead?<br/><br/>Consider that in the MC's choice of moves. Consider that when picking from lists for character creation.

Given that you don\u2019t need to use any dice to get a nice dramatic decision point. Why do you use dice? Why not just have the GM constantly describe outcomes that lead to the most intense and dramatic situations?</p></div></blockquote>\nYou're conflating 2 different things and making them look like they're the same. I've been mostly talking about tables and randomness to generate setting content. I think that's fine, but by no means a priority for every game. Using dice for conflict resolution is another thing, which I also like. Some narr games don't use it, but I mostly like some randomness when it comes to conflicts. The potential I see in it is that sometimes players just want their characters to solve a conflict the easiest way possible (avoiding a dilemma or hard choice, for example). Here, the dice bring the setting and genre constraints that lead to some hard choices on behalf of the player. Externalizing this to dice makes it easier for me, the GM, and less predictable. Sometimes characters will actually avoid making a hard choice and just, I don't know, start the revolution without spilling blood.<br/><br/>Regarding your example, I don't know what that "roll a trait" means in D&amp;D5th. But in my mind, your example is conflict resolution with an explicit intent stated by the player, which means I would never resolve it by rolling on a random table. In BW, I'd have him roll Circles to find a suitable noble to be conned, a roll where the player gets full use of their resources to affect the outcome, unlike a random table.<br/><br/>Imagine the player just said this, you go on and roll on a table to generate the noble, and find out he's deeply in debt. Why have you presented him an NPC that's useless to his purposes? Why don't the PC social skills factor in the noble he'll get to con? Will he have to skip that noble for you to keep rolling on that table until he finds someone suitable? For me, a Circles roll summarizes that whole process in a way where the result is relevant to the intent the player has, in a way that's connected to the PC skills rather than fully random.<br/><br/>As a side note, I'd make the roll in the open. I don't see the value in hiding a roll from the player, but that's just me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Khimus" title="Khimus"><img alt="Khimus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Khimus">Khimus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484335/#Comment_484335" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-26T16:38:43+00:00" title="May 26, 2019  4:38PM">May 26</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2019 5:43PM by Khimus.">edited May 26</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" rel="nofollow">EmmatheExcrucian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Unless I'm misunderstanding, Sandra isn't at all saying that blorb is better than everything and that games where significant facts can get decided later in play.

Or, to take it further, why every game with GM has to be blorby? Why can't players deal with a hybrid distribution of responsibilities, like they have for almost a decade or more? <br/>I'd actually root this discussion in actual play examples where these games supposedly produce incoherent play, rather than keep it in the air, because I just can't see the consequences of unblorbiness and I need concrete examples.\n<blockquote>all traditional roleplaying games should be wholly blorby.</blockquote>\nThis needs to be proved first.

The idea is that an internally consistent and causally coherent in-game universe is presented to players, who are thereby able to more easily imagine that the game-world has an independent existence. A concomitant of this is the precept that the GM is the medium through which information about the world is transmitted to players. What I hear Sandra calling for is a commitment on the part of the GM to devise information about the world in line with a scheme that privileges pre-planned info, masks the character of procedurally generated info, and deprecates the value of off-the-cuff invention. The benefit of this approach, as far as I can tell, has to do with the coherence of the fictional setting. This seems in Forge terms to be pure Right to Dream of Setting/System--where the setting and the system are really intertwined. It's an interesting approach; I wonder about the role or function of the player in it.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484338/#Comment_484338" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-26T19:02:07+00:00" title="May 26, 2019  7:02PM">May 26</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" rel="nofollow">Bill_White</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I wonder about the role or function of the player in it.</p></div></blockquote>\nStress testers, obviously <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484340/#Comment_484340" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-26T19:38:55+00:00" title="May 26, 2019  7:38PM">May 26</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill,<br/><br/>In Forge terms, a \u201cblorby\u201d approach allows the GM to act as much as possible as an objective referee, adjudicating impartially and having a clean, repeatable and unbiased process for establishing the facts of the world/adventure/environment. This means relying on objective techniques which take the GM\u2019s judgment out of those decisions. (This is, obviously to me, an impossible goal, but striving towards can make a big difference in play style.)<br/><br/>When the GM is operating in this way, it frees up the players to pursue a Step On Up agenda against the backdrop of established facts and impartial adjudication. If you make a plan to use a magic mirror to trap a demon, it works because you correctly ascertained the function of the mirror (because it was objectively determined and/or prepped), making the success of your plan based on your luck or ingenuity, not the subjective judgment of the GM. That makes for real loss and victory conditions in a way that a GM deciding which it was after the fact simply does not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484342/#Comment_484342" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-26T19:49:40+00:00" title="May 26, 2019  7:49PM">May 26</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes sense, Paul.

You already acknowledge that there are playstyles which do not involve blorb, just like there are pizzas without tomato sauce: there\u2019s no contradiction there! <br/><br/>In addition, there is or more point of difference:<br/><br/>In play with a Narrativist priority, there is no need for strict blorb. It is, by definition, not the priority. Some blorbiness can be really nice, but it doesn\u2019t make or break the game.<br/><br/>(To show otherwise, you\u2019d have to come with an example of how a failure to use blorb methods in a Narrativist game led to problems and people failing to address premise and enjoy themselves. That\u2019s what would begin to convince me there\u2019s something to talk about - until then, we\u2019re just talking about we like or dislike.)<br/><br/>There are also significant advantages to non-blorby play, which are sometimes desirable for just about any game style.

(Sandra will undoubtedly say that she "gets a charge" from seeing the gloracle in operation, but I'm quite confident that's not the actual creative payoff of the game - or, even it was for Sandra, it wouldn't be for other people using the same techniques - we've had lots and lots of conversations about that earlier and even ran a bit of a Story Games online campaign using those techniques. In theory, "blorb" can be used as a technique in any mode of play, but, in practice, it's most often used to facilitate a Step On Up agenda, which is why it needs to be adhered to *strictly* - as you can imagine, given a different creative agenda, there wouldn't likely be any need for it to be so strict.)<br/><br/>I can <i>imagine</i> a group purely enjoying the "gloracular Machine in operation" as their main creative goal, but I doubt very many people do. Sandra's game uses D&amp;D adventure modules, for example, as a large component of play - it wouldn't make much sense to do that in a game which is purely interested in Exploration of that sort, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484350/#Comment_484350" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-26T20:26:32+00:00" title="May 26, 2019  8:26PM">May 26</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" rel="nofollow">Bill_White</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>That makes sense, Paul.

Sandra mentioned earlier that she does, and I think my own preferences overlap quite a lot with a kind of pure respect for blorb, particularly in games where the gloracle is an unwieldy, caterwauling behemoth constantly threatening to careen off a cliff.<br/><br/>There's a certain subset of rules lawyers and min-maxers (I think) who aren't really looking to game the setting <i>in order to win</i>, or at least for whom Stepping On Up is secondary to simply plunging into the depths of the system to see just how far it can go (for example, it's unlikely you will ever use a Great Cleave "teleport" to actually circumvent a challenge; it's just fun to imagine the wave of gore that follows in your wake as you break the sound barrier). These players are more like Johnnys in Magic the Gathering parlance, who use the game as a vehicle of "creative expression." It's just that most games that have a lot of support for this <i>also</i> happen to be firmly Step On Up. I suspect a lot of people who prefer GMing these sorts of games also have a lot of overlap with this profile.<br/><br/>I've personally taken to calling this style of play Mousetrapping, after the Milton Bradley boardgame where watching the game's Rube Goldberg device namesake in action is by almost any measure far more interesting than actually "playing" the game. It's not exactly the same as pure, unsullied blorb-love but it heavily relies on the precepts of blorb.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ebear" title="ebear"><img alt="ebear" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ebear">ebear</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484354/#Comment_484354" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-26T20:55:53+00:00" title="May 26, 2019  8:55PM">May 26</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So <a href="/forums/profile/Khimus">@Khimus</a> I've got an actual play example from when I was running a one shot of Monster of the Week for strangers at the mall yesterday. I realize I already complained about MotW in this thread, but I think the situation I'm describing could have come up in an Apocalypse World game as well. I'm not a master class GM so there might be other issues going on here (and I'm totally interested in suggestions), but I felt like there were some competing expectations that came from having "harm" as part of the system. If it feels nitpicky and weird I'm sorry.<br/><br/>One of my guiding principles when I run anything non-blorby (which is pretty frequent) actually comes from the introduction of Dogs in the Vineyard: <blockquote>[...] if you're the GM, feel free to tell the players things their character's can't know. "You cut out across the field towards the smoldering wagon. There's a gang of robbers hiding in the grass and behind a couple of nearby trees. You haven't seen them yet. What do you do?"</blockquote> That was a big deal for me when I first read it, and I use it a lot when running Trollbabe even though examples in that text explicitly contradict it. Without it I feel like players decisions for there characters have less impact because I have too much power to effect the stakes after they've already made a decision.<br/><br/>Ok here's the background for the example: The monster hunters are at a teenage dance party in the woods where they have just started playing a CD that turns anyone who listens to it into a demon possessed serial killer. Kai (a PC who is half fae) and her cousin Erris (NPC who is fully fae) run up through the crowd to the stage just as everyone is turning into psycho killers. Kai gets caught up in a fight before she gets to the stage but Erris actually makes it up onto the stage and grabs the disk. Just as she gets the disk though, Joel (her boyfriend now possessed by demon music) grabs her and is about to stab her with a knife so she throws the disk to Kai (the actual PC) who runs to try and catch it. Across the field Earnest (another PC who is Erris' ex lover) levels his gun and tries to shoot Joel before he can stab Erris.<br/><br/>Ok here's the part that got a little weird: So I had set up this Joel is about to stab Erris situation which I guess was a soft move. The PC Earnest wants to shoot Joel both because he's trying to save Erris and also because he really hates Joel. I decide this sounds more like Act Under Pressure rather than Kick Some Ass. Earnest get's a 7-9 result which means "the Keeper is going to give you a worse outcome, a hard choice, or price to pay." I tell Earnest's player that if he shoots he will hit Joel but the bullet is going to hit Erris too. We can argue about whether that was a good "price to pay" or not but it's what I chose. Earnest decides to pull the trigger, there's a bang, and Joel and Erris fall off the stage.<br/> <br/>Now the problem: The phrase "the bullet is going to hit Erris too" feels like it should have an established meaning in the game because we have this harm system, but as Earnest is walking over to Erris I still have no idea whether she's A. basically fine (she's fae after all) B. in dangerous condition C. dead. I know I can't pick C. because part of Joel's declared intent was to save her. But about the other two? Monster of the Week just tells me pick whichever one sounds better (bottom of pg. 213). <b>I'm not saying there's anything wrong with making the decision on those terms, but it also means I should have made that decision earlier and told Earnest's player what the stakes were before he pulled the trigger.</b> And maybe that's where this example ends since I've clearly identified my mistake. But at the same I'm just wondering if the system could have helped me more here. For the record I picked B. which in retrospect feels like both the worst narrative decision (Erris is probably already mad at Earnest for shooting her even if she's more or less uninjured, and that's a more interesting consequence to me) and also the most like I'm playing "gotcha" with the players. It was the end of a very long session with no breaks so we all just went and got dinner after that. Earnest's player didn't complain to me about the outcome exactly but he seemed pretty dissatisfied (I was too).<br/><br/>But also Monster of the Week is basically a straw doll in this regard. The equivalent passage in Apocalypse World is much more interesting (honestly it has reignited my love for AW as a system) but still seems like it has an issue for me. Here's the description of what happens when an NPC takes 2-harm:\n<blockquote>wounds, bad pain, broken bones, shock. <b>Likely</b> fatal, <b>Occasionally</b> immediately fatal.</blockquote> (bolding is my emphasis)<br/>The above is followed by:\n<blockquote>If you don't like deciding arbitrarily, you can roll for it. Consider all the probability words above in d6 terms, trying to roll high: "generally" and "likely" mean on a 2-6; [...] But I think you can decide just fine for yourself if you want to.</blockquote>\nI honestly think that's awesome in some ways, but I also think it still points to the issue <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> is highlighting. If the player has no gaurantee as to whether the GM will incorporate the gloracle into the decision or not then the gloracle loses all it's magic for setting expectations and seems kind of incoherent. I feel like the gloracle could make Earnest's decision to shoot or not shoot Erris a lot more interesting, but only if it's incorporated correctly.<br/><br/>I actually still have a lot of hope for all of the above though and I'm really interested to hear people's thoughts on this. <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> seems to be suggesting that the gloracle and prep should be used for everything but the "wallpaper" as the solution, and I think that works. But I wonder if we were explicit about which outcomes were under the domain of the gloracle and which weren't if we could capture some of the gloracle/blorby magic while still leaving wiggle room in other places. This got pretty long winded so sorry about that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484356/#Comment_484356" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-26T21:44:49+00:00" title="May 26, 2019  9:44PM">May 26</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2019 9:45PM by 2097.">edited May 26</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Khimus" rel="nofollow">Khimus</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>all traditional roleplaying games should be wholly blorby.</p></div></blockquote>This needs to be proved first.

And also that\u2019s REALLY bad form of you pushing me so hard on this topic. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23emo2097&amp;Mode=like">#emo2097</a> Unlike you, my real name\u2013Sandra Snan\u2013is out here on Story Games. If someone misunderstands me as not liking this beloved-by-millions TV show\u2026 I don\u2019t want that to happen. I think a lot of things about the show is great. And Mercer is an absolute sweetheart who I really admire in many ways.</p><p>The things I personally like the most about them and that as far as I understand most fans &amp; participants like the most of them, judging from how they get selected and put into \u201cbest of\u201d-clips and similar, are either things that <em>are</em> wholly blorby [moments when the events are extremely emergent rather than pre-planned], or wholly orthogonal to blorb. There\u2019s nothing unblorby about the characters and their interactions.</p><p>The things that I don\u2019t like, and the Colbert episode (like the Vin Diesel episode before it) has a clearer example of this than anything I\u2019ve seen on the CR show proper, is when I suspect that there is unblorbiness going on behind the scenes; when I suspect illusiory techniques. Spoiler warning for the Colbert episode: the way it ended seemed very \u201cpaced as a story\u201d and not emergent, which <strong>if true</strong>, is to me not taking advantage of the medium of a roleplaying game.</p><p>So some <em>important</em> caveats to that.</p><ol><li>That ending <em>could</em> happen. I don\u2019t know or care about how Mercer runs his games. Unless you practice radical transparency of method, it\u2019s hard to see to what extent <em>any</em> given game complies with the blorbiness decree. Blorb happens at the engine level, not on the surface level.</li><li>\u201cMedium of roleplaying game\u201d; but that Colbert TV show <em>is</em> also a show. It has to comply with the expectations of two mediums at once; possibly compromising one or both of them. (That doesn\u2019t mean I think compromising blorb is heartwarming.)</li><li><strong>I don\u2019t want to gatekeep specific GMs</strong> as saying \u201cyou\u2019re doing it wrong\u201d; I want to <strong>teach blorb</strong> because I believe it can <em>improve</em> their games, not because I want to lord it over them, be smug over them, say that they\u2019re bad or w/e. I learned this lesson in the worst way during TitansGrave.</li><li>Advice shows! When someone like Mick Ryley or Matt Colville puts himself up as <em>the</em> DM teacher number one and teaches pure &amp; evil anti-blorb, that\u2019s something I <em>do</em> take issue with. Mercer\u2019s own advice show, that I didn\u2019t watch a lot of, seemed very humble and polite and vague by comparison.</li></ol><p>Back in the Critical Role thread, <strong>I</strong> was the one who was all gung-ho and \u201cLeave Britney alone!\u201d when several posters here were criticizing the show in a very patronizing way.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484357/#Comment_484357" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-26T21:44:59+00:00" title="May 26, 2019  9:44PM">May 26</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>There is no need for blorb to \u201cdie\u201d!

For instance, you could have just asked your players, set up a clock for the threat of Erris' death, or whatever else is given as an option.<br/><br/>Have you talked to the player to get to know how he felt? I don't see the game situation as something so terrible. It's certainly possible for a bullet shot at a fight, to harm an unintended target.

What I read here is the players were unclear on what the principles of this style of gaming were. They didn't want blorbiness or consistency, they wanted the illusion not to be torn apart. I've found this in other games, and many players are ok even with illusionist techniques, as long as the illusion remains. Keeping an illusion is worth that much of an effort? Definitely not for me.

I don't think I've ever told Sandra that her "real love" is challenge (it's very clear that the blorb dollhouse/gloracle is foremost in your heart!), or that her group plays with a Step On Up agenda (if I have, let me know, and I'll gladly take it back as well as apologize). Like Eero, I don't see any hope or benefit in labeling strangers online with some vague theory terms (unless they ask for it, I suppose, but no one's really ever asked me to do so). It's foolish, disrespectful, and far too likely to be entirely wrong.<br/><br/>Eero and I have both found a really successful mode of play which combines "blorb" (Sandra's term) or "hygienic GMing" (Eero's term) with a strong Step On Up agenda for really effective and highly focused gaming. I find that, once you get those concepts lined up (and learn to stick to them), it's almost bulletproof. Those ideas have allowed me to enjoy D&amp;D without reservation for the first time.<br/><br/>Unlike Sandra (but perhaps like Eero), I find both to be absolutely necessary to make it work. I played with strict "blorb" for years and years and never had that kind of gaming until the missing piece - the focus on challenge, and a recognition that it was happening even when it might seem like it's not (more about that below) - was brought in, thanks to Eero.<br/><br/>It does require a slightly more sophisticated understanding of "challenge", though (at least, enough that I could see it tripping some people up). Given that understanding, "blorb" tells us HOW to prepare material and make rules and rulings, while "focus on challenge" tells us WHEN to use it (how to distinguish wallpaper from things that are important to prep). Put the two together, and you have a working method for play that really, really works. Have just one, and you're lucky if the thing goes at all.<br/><br/>The key that's kind of weird (or, at least, easy to miss) is that the GM, in this style of play, isn't engaged in the process the same way that the players are. The GM's role is to prep and make rulings and present vivid and concrete fiction; the whole point of blorb/hygienic practices is to remove the GM from the challenge/competition. (We want to remove the GM's ability to switch what the mirror does at the last minute precisely so that she cannot invalidate the cleverness of the players by switching up what's behind the curtain - and, similarly, so she cannot cheat around a poor decision by the players by changing things in their favour.)<br/><br/>As you can see, this has absolutely nothing to do with "game balance" (there are types of games that have similar techniques and a similar agenda which find game balance important, but this is a very different beast); it has do with <i>fairness</i>. <br/><br/>It can be really fun and really exciting for the players to go up against an overwhelmingly difficult challenge. It can be really fun and really exciting when the players manage to cleverly circumvent a challenge and get an easy victory: the point is not to provide balance, but to <i>make their decisions really matter</i>. That's one of the central functions of a sandbox setup: to let the players decide which challenges they want to confront.<br/><br/>When you play in this style, the GM sets up the "dollhouse" and the rules by which it functions, and then sits back to see what will happen. The players, meanwhile, rub their hands together, feeling confident that the GM isn't cheating, and get ready to be as clever and as lucky as possible: they are facing challenge, not the GM.<br/><br/>I think that it's easy to lose sight of this as a GM committed to "gloracular" methods, because you're not really engaged in the "challenge" aspect as a participant. However, if you imagine a day when you come to the table and the players aren't trying to survive and win - perhaps they put down their weapons and run into the dungeon with their eyes closed - and you'll see that they are very much engaging with challenge, because when they stop doing so, the whole purpose for play seems really unclear all of a sudden. <br/><br/>I don't know for sure what's happening in Sandra's game, of course (and we know there's quite a mish-mash of techniques, so there's likely, I think, a mish-mash of types of "fun" happening), but that's what I've seen pretty consistently in other games I've run and played.<br/><br/>Here are some examples of why this might be true for Sandra (she'll have to confirm or deny, but I'll show what I'm seeing):\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>&lt;&lt;p&gt;Really good example.</p><p>We had a very similar example in our game yesterday. A beloved hench NPC \u2013 or rather, the wife of one of the characters, rolled up on XGE life paths\u2013(well, she\u2019s not universally loved on the soap opera layer but they need her magic cello because it conjures a cabin for them to live and she also can conjure food and water for them with it, so they def don\u2019t want her to die) had her head stuck in a trap. The way the players dealt damage to the trap also risked her. She ended up making it out with only six hit points remaining.</p><p>The fact that this was handled gloracularly added a lot to the tension and to the outcome. Yet another triumph of blorb\u2665</p></div></blockquote>\nMy impression (and you can tell me if I'm wrong) is that the players weren't approaching the wife with her head stuck in a trap with a scientist's perspective ("Hey, I guess she could live or she could die. Let's engage this mechanical process, and we'll find out which in the end, but we'll be happy either way..." - "Oh! She'd be more likely to survive if we hit the trap with a hammer, becaus she has resistance to bludgeoning weapons..." "Shut up, Bob! You're ruining the experiment! Let's stick with the spears...") but as people desperately trying to save her life (looking for new solutions, different ideas, different ways that they could get her out alive).<br/><br/>In the end, knowing that you all followed the procedures faithfully makes the success feel more earned and more real - that makes it more valuable and more potent. But the key to it is that there was a challenge and the players managed to win (this time)! They saved her!

I know that it's not the only thing that happens in Sandra's games, but it seems to be, at least, one of the main features of play.<br/><br/>The "monster AI" for combat is another example: it enables the GM to remove herself from the flow of combat, giving the players a "system" of opposition to test their skills against. (If true simulation, a la Threefold, was, instead, the goal, then giving the monsters an "algorithm" but not the PCs would be a rather unbalanced simulation. The PCs have a strong advantage in this scenario; if the idea was to "simulate" or "test" the *characters'* battle effectiveness against certain monsters, it would make sense to write a similar algorithm/AI for the PCs, as well. The fact that this isn't even remotely on the table, is, again, a way to give an opportunity to the players to Step On Up and test their wits and skills against an objective reality/system.)<br/><br/>In "what did you play this week", Sandra talks about a particularly exciting, successful heist the players pulled off:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/483939/#Comment_483939" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/483939/#Comment_483939</a><br/><br/>This seems to me as another example of how cleverness and luck win out over adversity; what makes it cool is that the players were <i>smart</i>. They faced a challenge and they <i>won</i>. <br/><br/>Read that snippet (it describes a really awesome successful heist moment!), and tell me that it's celebrating anything other than a brilliant play by the players when faced with a challenge. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Which, on a related topic, if the game isn't about challenge at least at some level, why use D&amp;D adventure modules? Why play Finchian trap-disarming games? (Heck, why have deadly traps in the first place?) Why remove all the skills from the game that replace player cleverness? Etc.<br/><br/>I hope that makes my position clear. I could be utterly wrong about Sandra and her game, for all I know, but it's definitely a trend I've seen in different groups and different situations, and it explains a lot of those questions very cleanly and efficiently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484385/#Comment_484385" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-27T03:51:09+00:00" title="May 27, 2019  3:51AM">May 27</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread is moving a bit fast for me to completely follow, so consider this a parenthetical aside.<br/><br/><small>Context: <a href="/forums/profile/Khimus">@Khimus</a> says "hey note the Disclaim Decision Making principle", <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> replies "a.k.a. consult the gloracle."<br/><br/>Either I've misunderstood the gloracle a bit, or I don't really think these are always equivalent!<br/><br/>Another, rather non-gloracular way of disclaiming decision making is Burning Wheel style stakes-setting.

I'd say yes, but what's the big deal ?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484392/#Comment_484392" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-27T07:50:44+00:00" title="May 27, 2019  7:50AM">May 27</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I'd say yes, but what's the big deal ?</p></div></blockquote>\nAgreed!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484395/#Comment_484395" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-27T08:28:16+00:00" title="May 27, 2019  8:28AM">May 27</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Next step is : when is it okay to sort of railroad players.

It's teetering on the borderline; either a brilliant design or it falls down into the ravine of sorrow.</div></blockquote>\nWhat's your reasoning for calling this mechanic in AW kind of subjective? You know, there seem to be plenty of subjective gaps in starts without number and other dust too, many of them even recognised by the author. For once, the adventure generator works with abstract concept, like "person, place, complication", which the GM then puts in context. <br/><br/>Even this blorb machine, at best, is a machine with a human operating it, pressing the levers, feeding it input and interpreting the output. Like every other game. Even this fairness is kind of an illusion. A productive one, perhaps, but it's kind of delusional to think the whole machine is less subjective than "disclaim decision making" in AW.<br/><br/>Next question: has this method been used successfully for genres other than dungeon crawling? Dungeons are kind of easy because they're a constrained space with relatively few agents, but how do you leave everything to prep and tables in a city? Even SwN admits many, many times players will have you improvise. I can imagine tons of situations that will require more "subjectiveness" than AW's  "disclaim decision making", unless the GM actually creates every building and NPC and faction in every single location, which is kind of straining even for low populations of 10k.<br/><br/>At last: in one of your recent posts, you make a point that the challenge, or game, is about survival. That's so damn specific as a goal to play! I don't think a technique that narrows the play focus so much can be thought of as a must for every game with a GM, unless most of the campaigns, games and genres start looking like a reskin of of&amp;d modules!<br/><br/>What worries me here is that there's this segment of the hobby suddenly talking about fairness, about an impartial GM and about removing subjectivity from the act of GMing, like those things exist, all while they're blind to the MANY moments of subjectivity their gaming involves!<br/><br/>One last point: it could be argued that, as well as there is tension between traditional techniques and story now mechanics, there's tension also between this pretension for objectivity and fairness, and the need of a human interpreter/operator for this blorby machine. The disruptive tension seems lower, in my opinion, for traditional story games, which kind of acknowledge the human component in the activity (it's not a computer simulation, after all, but a social game), and design with this in mind. The blorby spectrum seems to try to overcompensate by loading with work a single person. As I said before, this amount of work just to keep the illusion living is not what I aim for in an RPG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484413/#Comment_484413" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-27T13:05:12+00:00" title="May 27, 2019  1:05PM">May 27</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Khimus" rel="nofollow">Khimus</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>What\u2019s your reasoning for calling this mechanic in AW kind of subjective?

Example: If the system we use is that the player has to use their wits to disarm the trap by describing things they do and the GM adjudicating, then that\u2019s going to shape the players excitement about the situation.<br/><br/>So the way I see salience is, it\u2019s a situation we\u2019re all excited about.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484451/#Comment_484451" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-27T17:08:23+00:00" title="May 27, 2019  5:08PM">May 27</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Salience: Do you <i>need</i> to know it?<br/>Wallpaper: Would it just be cool to know it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484452/#Comment_484452" name="Item_149" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-27T17:09:14+00:00" title="May 27, 2019  5:09PM">May 27</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Absolutely! <br/><br/>So, now, how do you know before it happens whether the situation will be something you\u2019re all excited about or not?<br/><br/>Is it pure trial and error, or do you have a good sense of that before you sit down and play?<br/><br/>That understanding is required for any kind of good gaming, and, in particular, it is just as necessary in order to know what to blorb and what not to blorb. <br/><br/>Basically, a sense of what the game is about: once that\u2019s in place, we can make intelligent decisions about whether something needs to be handled a certain way or not.

I'd say PCs actions are important because they reflect players decisions, which are important in any healthy game. <br/>So, that was just a bump. Paul_T's question before that was about the "situation". By that I think he meant "moment to moment". That is : when do you feel in your games that "yummy" feeling that "this (diegetic) thing is (going to be) cool" ?

That is valuable.</blockquote>\n- I can only argue by experience.  The game I play in does the exact same thing to our human players except many times the game is 100% non-blorb.  We will sit down, the GM will ask us to read off our characters and in less than 30 minutes were off and running and totally transported to another world.  I am utterly delighted at the success of your GMing and design efforts but I can't think of a game that is more diametrically opposed to blorby play than ours is from yours.  This isn't good or bad.  Just a <i>completely</i> different approach to the process of play.  Just one example - You push for absolute clarity of play (am I using the correct phrase?) while we embrace the fog of war.<br/><br/>Just my 2 cents.

The focus in your game (Sandra) is, it seems to me, to create something as "tangible" as possible that the players can then interact with. There are solid and predictable qualities and quantities and solid and reliable ways to interact with them. We know that there's something inside the treasure chest, and that, if we open it, Sandra won't change what it is on us. We know that the monsters will attack according to an algorithm. We know how much we can carry. And so on.<br/><br/>Jay/Cary's game is all about the experience of the world/story/characters, and uses obfuscation on every level to achieve that.<br/><br/>You want things to *be* as real and tangible as possible, and for player decisions to matter as much as possible. This demands transparency of method.<br/><br/>Cary wants things to *feel* as powerful as possible, and for the players' emotional experience to be immersive and memorable. This demands "fog of war", so that you can feel the tension and fear and uncertainty and experience it vicariously.<br/><br/>Complete opposites, in my opinion. I would engage in each of your games in a completely different way, and being a good player in them demands very different skills, approach, and mindset.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484525/#Comment_484525" name="Item_165" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-28T19:50:09+00:00" title="May 28, 2019  7:50PM">May 28</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Also, I'm not sure why the "fighting algorithm" went so far over your head.

I was saying that this thought experiment - imagining either of those things, and seeing how undesirable either of them is - reveals a lot about your play priorities.)<br/><br/>(For instance, if you started to think that "Threefold Simulationism" was your actual goal, you'd have to conclude that writing an algorithm for the PCs would be at least worth considering - it would play nicely into the "simulation", and give a better "answer", rather than giving one side a dramatic advantage over the other. And if your goal was an adversarial competition between the two sides, you'd want to take away the monsters' algorithm, because it handicaps one side. On the other hand, if your goal was to create a railroady story, you might want an algorithm for the PC side, and then to be able to improvise the monsters' actions, so as to steer the fight's outcome to your desired ends.)<br/><br/>(But your solution, instead, suits your game perfectly: and that's because it enables precisely what you want - for the GM to act as impartial referee, while a clear and definite, "real", tangible process gives the players something to test their wits and skills against.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" title="Silmenume"><img alt="Silmenume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">Silmenume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484529/#Comment_484529" name="Item_166" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-28T20:17:36+00:00" title="May 28, 2019  8:17PM">May 28</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 29, 2019 4:55AM by Silmenume.">edited May 29</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Sandra,\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>To clarify, Silmenume, blorb isn\u2019t about clarity [even though you\u2019re right that I <em>loooove</em> clarity], blorb is about the game world being consistent and \u201creal\u201d and the DM not changing things around behind the scenes, instead sticking to the truth of \u201cwhat\u2019s really there\u201d. </p></div></blockquote>\nFirst my apologies for mis-identifying what "blorb" meant.  Adding confusion serves no one's interests in forum discussions.  Mea culpa.<br/><br/>Here's the rub with "what's really <i>there</i>."  There is no ontological "there" there.  It's <i>all</i> an artificial construct manufactured by human beings.  As far as role-playing games are concerned (the act of Exploration as defined by Setting, Character, Situation, Color and System) the only "reality" that matters is the SIS.  Which is also an artificial construct.  The primacy of the SIS is so vital because it covers the idea of <i>all</i> the players interacting with it with agency as mediated by System.  This is the uniqueness of RPGs as compared to other recreational pastimes.  It is a group imagination process...a highly ritualized form of conversation if you will.<br/><br/>We use physical props to influence this conversation but they are no more "truth" than the SIS.  This includes having pre-written notes on "what's really there".  Until these things enter the SIS directly in themselves (physical things) or affect the physical things (a pile of enriched Uranium that is causing radiation sickness in people but is itself not [yet] established) then they are merely potentialities under the control of the GM.<br/><br/>I'm not arguing against game prep as a useful process.  I'm just arguing that it is merely a technique to help with the player who is functioning in the role of "GM".  If this technique helps the person of "GM" facilitate their players to "immerse" into the artificially constructed world then bully for the GM!  Good for that person for finding a method of GMing that works for them.  However that <i>technique of prep</i> does not represent "truth" any more than a game where the GM does no pre-game prep.  As far as the SIS is concerned there is no difference.  The only thing that matters are the words spoken by the GM.  It is only then that when those words are accepted as credible via the Lumpley Principle do they <i>matter</i>.<br/><br/>Now we get into issues of player protagonization WRT to CA's.  There is a form of deprotagonizaton that crosses all CA's (when a player is shut out from entering anything into the SIS) but there is also CA specific player deprotagonization.  Paul Czege argued this WRT how this worked in Narratist play which is <i>very different</i> with how player deprotagonization functions in Gamist play.  I was going to post a link to the thread but the Forge Archives seem to be down.<br/><br/>I'm seeing two basic thrusts to your arguments.<br/><br/>First is a matter of trust among the players and the GM.  Blorb preparation deals with this by not dealing with said trust but by player verification of GM pre-game notes.  There are other ways of handling this including but not limited to game design, System and being consistently straight with one's players.  I gave you the example of the Elf running on water for the latter.<br/><br/>Second the magic of the Gloricle (which I believe is a description of "blorby" play) leads to player "immersion."  Great!  That is a <i>Technique</i> you employ to help facilitate getting your players to a state of being - that of "immersion".  That's a hard thing to do in general and that you manage to achieve it regularly is to be commended.  But <i>it isn't the only way</i> to facilitate the same effect in the one's players.  I know this to be true because of the game I play in.  I currently don't fully understand how it all works, but I've been afforded some theoretical assistance via Myth and Bricolage.  I'm not implying this other method is better, I'm just stating that it does exist and it too works very well at facilitating player "immersion".<br/><br/>I'll address your other points in a follow up post.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484530/#Comment_484530" name="Item_167" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-28T20:19:26+00:00" title="May 28, 2019  8:19PM">May 28</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The focus in your game (Sandra) is, it seems to me, to create something as \u201ctangible\u201d as possible that the players can then interact with.</p></div></blockquote><p>Ain\u2019t disputing that but I was replying to some specifics in the post such as the clarity-vs-fog-of-war question being A. orthogonal to the blorb question, and B. not that effective in its stated goal: get players engage to engage with real-world-logic.

The "tangible" play here is exactly what I have focused my Torchbearer GM-ing on, and I think it's something the game does really well by making time, light, inventory, etc into completely player-facing currencies.  I also play with transparent obstacles (the difficulty rating of each roll).  Players can look to the back of the book and tell me the difficulty of brewing a certain elixir, or a vertical ascent with two climbers (I get to add +1 ob for extenuating circumstances, or grant them an extra die for an advantage, but that's the extent of my GM influence).<br/><br/>I think the few of my friends that didn't take to the system either said that it was too complicated or it wasn't immersive.  I don't actually think Torchbearer is more complicated than other dungeon crawling games, but far more of the rules are player-facing.  This thread has helped me see why some folks had a problem with immersion.  Every time I explained a new system, I was supporting my agenda of a transparent, tangible game but undermining their desire for a bit of "fog of war".<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484589/#Comment_484589" name="Item_173" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-29T12:42:54+00:00" title="May 29, 2019 12:42PM">May 29</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good insight!

I was expecting something... stronger... from the opening line ("Narrativism with traditional techniques is bullshit!"), though. Like some kind of fundamental incompatibility or some theoretical problem.<br/><br/>I also agree that traditional techniques are not ideal for Narrativist play; but overlooking the dozens of published games and the decades of experience people have had playing in that style would be very strange - Narrativist play with traditional techniques is all there was for people for most of the lifespan of roleplaying games.

And it's one reason to use "blorb prep" or traditional techniques, or both, for some people, in their Narrativist endeavours. But that's a very personal thing; for some people "blorbiness" helps with "feeling like you're there", for others it's that but also trust in the GM, for others still it's just about emotional connection to the story, and for some it's familiar mechanics that they don't need to spend any brain power parsing.<br/><br/>I also like some aspects of "blorb" for this reason; but I don't *need* it at all to "feel like I'm there", as I've discovered after playing a variety of games. (Though the trust in the game, the process, and the people is really key; and that's where it might come into play for you and me. Not everyone needs that, though, particularly if they've never had bad GM experiences, for instance.)\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/></p><p>It\u2019s rather that character life&amp;death is salient.

You really don't see how "character life &amp; death" and "character quest success" are issues of challenge? All those are challenges for the players to confront and try to win.<br/><br/>Have you ever played in a game where someone wanted to play a martyr, and wanted a glorious death? Or to see their character fall into a deep depression and commit suicide? Or tell the story of a man pursuing a "quest" for all the wrong reasons, failing, and learning something about himself in the process?<br/><br/>There are lots of games and playstyles where those issues aren't on the table at all.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>I don\u2019t see how \u201cblorby prep\u201d is as necessary in Narrativist play (and have yet to see an example to demonstrate why it would be harmful) as it is in this kind of game;</p></div></blockquote><p>Maybe you\u2019ve missed posts?

I thought about writing about it, but I thought I'd come off as even more annoying to you.<br/><br/>You see, I think that example actually strengthens my argument here, rather than being a counterpoint.<br/><br/>What I'm looking for is an example of Narrativist play with traditional mechanics, right? And how not using "hygienic" practices (I'm getting really tired of using "blorb" in sentences, I think I much prefer "hygienic" and "gloracle" or "principled prep") ruined the Narrativism.<br/><br/>In this case, we have a game which is not very traditional (anyone who's read Lady Blackbird can attest to that, I think) and isn't supposed to be run in a traditional way (it specifically tells you not to plan ahead, and asking the players questions to establish the fictional situation should clue players in to its improvisational nature right away).<br/><br/>Furthermore, there's absolutely no reason I can see to assume (from that writeup) that there was any Narrativism happening.<br/><br/>What I see is players engaging in what they thought was challenge-based play, and being disappointed when it turned out that it wasn't. This could be read as a failure of non-blorbiness in challenge-based play, perhaps, but not as a failure to produce Narrativism.<br/><br/>(I say "perhaps" because the players in this case were rather deluded, I think; coming up with the "steam dragon" solution is actually far more clever and interesting if it was their original idea than if it had been a "GM's plan". Their <i>real</i> disappointment was not that they didn't get to face a proper challenge and win... it was in their own misguided belief that the GM was controlling the whole experience and had planned it all out. In other words, it's not that their premise-addressing or challenge-overcoming was invalidated - again, coming up with that solution is just as clever and just as successful whether the GM improvised the dragon or not, so long as the GM didn't come up with the steam breath thing *in response* to their being out of coal - but that they were disappointed to discover Tod <i>hadn't</i> rigged it all from the start.)<br/><br/>(Perhaps a better way to say it: they thought that "figure out Tod's secret plan" was the challenge here, and they were disappointed to discover that it was "figure out something that works on your own", instead. Personally, I would have been excited by that, rather than disappointed - it would mean that it was genuinely my original idea and a clever solution to the diegetic problem.)<br/><br/>(None of that has anything to do with traditional vs. non-traditional mechanics or Narrativism at all - not that I can see, anyway.)\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Using GURPS.</p></div></blockquote>\nHa!

Ideally your game have or would have similar knowledge; like how you know that daggers &amp; arrows do PBP damage in your game. It wouldn\u2019t be great if you didn\u2019t know that, right? All of a sudden an arrow kills you and you were like \u201cwait what? I had like 50 stamina left.\u201d</blockquote>\nSee, this is interesting.  The reason for the very existence of this particular mechanic is very different from task resolution mechanics typically employed in Gamist facilitating games.  The DM didn't create this mechanic (dagger &amp; arrows bypassing stamina and doing straight PBP) so as to present the players with a ex-diegetic tactical option.  He created this mechanic so that the players of high level characters never stop fearing (read - experiencing) for their lives in combat - even against your bog standard issue, Mark I, first level Orc.  IOW that mechanic wasn't designed to clarify to the player what can and cannot be done but rather to instill a sense of <i>player fear</i>.<br/><br/>Also note in your example of the surprised player at the implied sudden <i>change</i> of the fabric of reality of the fictional world.  The presumption presented was that arrows doing direct PBP was never heretofore encountered.  That was never the case.  If the GM were to suddenly make a sudden hard break from the bricoled reality of the world there would be a riot at the table - that would be a form of CA specific player deprotagonization.  Part of the Process of play in this CA is the player figuring out how the world works and that can only happen if the <i>presented</i> reality (read - the actions demonstrated within the SIS) is consistent.  IOW - we don't need to have ex-diegetic mechanics to tell us that arrows are deadly when 40 years of gaming always had arrows act with the same lethal effect.\n<blockquote>In your game a lot of the time the DM is saying \u201cYou do this, this and this. Roll a twenty-sided!\u201d and you reply \u201c1d20 + 7 = 8\u201d and he says \u201cOK the enemy does this, this and this! Roll a twenty-sided!\u201d and you reply \u201c1d20 = 16\u201d and he says \u201cOh wow, it almost this this but you this and this and this! And then you this and this and this! Roll a twenty-sided!\u201d and you reply \u201c1d20 + 7 = 21\u201d and he says \u201cno you almost this but then this and this, and suddenly a big this!!!! wow! roll a twenty-sided!\u201d and you go NATURAL TWENTY! and everyone cheers.<br/><br/>And I\u2019m like\u2026 wait when are you doing things except just listing numbers? Sometimes. Creating characters. Talking about the scenario before the game. </blockquote>\nUnfortunately you got tripped up by the nature of the communicating in a textural medium.  What isn't being accounted for, because it would be such a verbose process, is all the somatic stuff we're doing at the table.  Much but not all, granted, of the GM saying "you do this" or "you do that" is his verbalizing our mimed actions.  What you're hearing (or what I've posted) is only a part of the total communication process and for the most part is the lesser part during combat.  Numbers are part of that communicative process.  They point at the <i>relative</i> boon or bust of fate at that moment but the specifics come from the SIS which equals GM description.  How (not what) he describes these events is a matter of style and mood and in the case of combat at our table the mode of description is designed to be as exciting and dramatic as possible.  Those die rolls are part of that excitement because we don't know exactly what will come of them.  We have to be deeply focused on the value of the numbers because of just how granular the combat is on a somatic level.  IOW we have to be prepared to react instantly to a result that isn't what we hoped.\n<blockquote>But some of the time it\u2019s the DM saying what you do. \u201cYou go in.\u201d \u201cYou crash through the door.\u201d \u201cYou pull out your knife.\u201d That is not same logic processes I engage in real life.</blockquote>\nMost of this is covered in the above portion of the post, but I'm not seeing how these example statements invalidate the process of us players working out what is going on in the world - including such intangibles as the significance of any event, if any.  Granted much of this is background but it does serve the purpose of maintaining the baseline of the world.  Its when events stray from the necessary baseline that we engage the logic process.  That logic process demands a baseline in order to work.  To point to instances of baseline stuff as evidence of how the logic process doesn't work or apply misses the whole point of the baseline.<br/><br/>There is more of your post to cover and I will get there as soon as I can.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484629/#Comment_484629" name="Item_180" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-29T21:56:56+00:00" title="May 29, 2019  9:56PM">May 29</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, if that\u2019s your position, we have nothing to disagree on.

It\u2019s not about math tactics, it\u2019s about creating an emotional response in the player that matches the intended diegetics (although I do take care so that the math tactics line up with what\u2019s emotionally engaging diegetically; i.e.\xa0you don\u2019t want the \u201cbest\u201d move on the dice layer to be something completely unnatural and boring, a la the problem Magic ran into with the Odyssey expansion giving your patrol hounds first strike seven times, completely reduntantly, just so that you could have enough cards in your graveyard to fuel some other spell\u2014I (and Cary) have someawareness of the dice-level tactical implications of the rules we design to prevent bad gameplay like that).</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>He created this mechanic so that the players of high level characters never stop fearing (read - experiencing) for their lives in combat - even against your bog standard issue, Mark I, first level Orc.

To answer your question in short - No.  Never once can I remember a game that came anywhere near to what Paul had described.<br/><br/>Now the longer reply.  Our chosen <i>style</i> of game is epic heroic.  A slow death to the elements just isn't part of the experience.  FREX - instead of the piece being irrevocably broken it might just be badly damaged and need time to be repaired.  Time that is not in abundance due to an extremely limited oxygen supply.  We would also find that the planet wasn't so uninhabited afterall.  So now we've got a ticking clock, a possible way out, action/hostile foes and longs odds on hope.<br/><br/>Just before I joined the group there was a scenario that was very similar to what Paul described but set in ME.  A ship had been caught in a storm and blown to a deserted island.  The ship had been damaged and needed repairs to be seaworthy again.  Food and water were in short supply.  To keep thing moving the players had to explore the island for supplies whereby they found not one living creature.  They quickly surmised something "bad" was on the island and raced against time to build a small stockade as the sun relentlessly trekked across the sky.  Sure enough there were ghouls on the island and to make matters worse a PC had got caught outside the stockade when the sun went down.  Apparently it was a new player and his face got so red (and a vein starting bulging on his forehead) that the GM actually stopped running to ask if the player was OK.  Apparently the fear was this player was going to have a stroke or a heart attack.  Seriously.  Needless to say his character died a hideous death.<br/><br/>However after the game when asked what he thought of his experience.  He answered, hands trembling as he lit up a smoke, "That was the most amazing experience of my life.  I'll never do that again.  I play to relax."<br/><br/>I'm sure this is obvious to anyone whose read any of my AP posts, we don't play a Klockwerk game.  Situations are always introduced to increase levels of tension.  One of the techniques our GM uses is to have at least one and usually several NPCs with the group to create or ratchet up conflict so all conflict isn't always just environmental - that being monsters or nature.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager

To me it all comes down to preference.<br/><br/>I have definitely had the feeling some people are expressing, where I love PbtA games but I wonder if it\u2019s possible to make them a bit less wiggly and fiat feeling. I\u2019ve played and MCed PbtA probably only a dozen times so take the following with a grain of salt. I always felt like if a PCs character happed to die it would be because of a choice I made as a MC rather than a natural result of the mechanics. <br/><br/>Maybe I didn\u2019t understand the rules well but that is how it felt and there\u2019s something I don\u2019t like about that. It takes away the true danger of the situation and makes character death into a player\u2019s decision (the MCs) wherein death doesn\u2019t seem random and there could be bad feelings between players. <br/><br/>I would like a PbtA game where the real risk of death was present and things were a bit more cut and dry, and didn\u2019t feel so dependent upon the MCs improved choices. The game I MCed was The Sword, the Crown and Unspeakable Power, which is a great game. I\u2019ve also played AW and DW. Maybe I MCed it in a different way than typical? Is this impression I\u2019m getting accurate or is death more a cut and dry and the result of game mechanics and the fudging was on my end? <br/><br/>Maybe it is the sense that your making up enemies on the spot sometimes, which can feel arbitrary, rather than preparing the encounters beforehand. It might be nice to do a sandbox kind of thing with PbtA so it felt a bit less arbitrary and MC determined? Obviously, the drama is the main point of most PbtA games and character death isn\u2019t the focus but it would be nice, for personal tastes, to make if it felt less wiggly. <br/><br/>Edit: I just read Kenny_J\u2019s response on the \u201cAre there non-trad, non-d&amp;d sandbox games?\u201d which went into the idea of doing a PbtA sandbox style game. I think it would do a good job addressing some of looseness and helping to make the game feel more solid and less MC fiat dependent. Kenny\u2019s got some really cool ideas.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484724/#Comment_484724" name="Item_204" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-30T19:48:27+00:00" title="May 30, 2019  7:48PM">May 30</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I'm sure this is obvious to anyone whose read any of my AP posts, we don't play a Klockwerk game.

I basically just mean the different general RPG game design categories often appeal to different tastes. But I definitely agree that there is a big difference between a good game and a bad game within those categories. For example, their are a lot of GMless games that just leave the players hanging and don\u2019t do a sufficient job of reconstituting some of the stuff the GM does.<br/><br/>I was basically trying to say something like the following: I like both D&amp;D and PbtA games, and there are bad designs within those two different game design categories, but that D&amp;D and PbtA have different features and they can both be good games but just appeal to people with different tastes. But I agree that some games are better than others and if one is discussing design it\u2019s necessary to make judgments about that if one is going to get anywhere.  <br/><br/>To tell you the truth, I\u2019m kind of lost on this thread; I haven\u2019t posted in a while and I\u2019m not caught up with the topics you all have been discussing and the new jargon you all are using\u2014I\u2019m seriously not even sure I totally understand what the conversation is about.

You get a lot of stuff happening, a lot of hi-jinx, but it\u2019s emotionally unsatisfying. The mechanics tend to get used to introduce \u2018stuff\u2019 rather than resolve conflicts on the dramatic level.<br/><br/>Most 90\u2019s games fail (for Narrativism) because the situation isn\u2019t strong and the characters are weak. There\u2019s no shared interesting in \u2018resolving the already untenable situation\u2019, so instead the GM ends up introducing elements ad-hoc to make things interesting. The problem is that interesting is ill defined.<br/><br/>If we\u2019re on the same page about what\u2019s interesting and committed to playing to find out, then no-myth elements are less intrusive because the character actions are still consequential.<br/><br/>If you\u2019re not on the same page then games like Apocalypse World create different versions of the \u2018quantum ogre\u2019 problem. Either our choice is inconsequential because the GM just fudges behind the scenes (for drama) or the resolution system ends up introducing \u2018ogres for drama\u2019 rather than actually resolving the conflict we want resolved.<br/><br/>Or to put it in entirely different terms. Apocalypse World relies on the spirit of emergence more than it does on mechanically nailing things down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aik" title="Aik"><img alt="Aik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aik">Aik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484733/#Comment_484733" name="Item_210" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-30T21:35:12+00:00" title="May 30, 2019  9:35PM">May 30</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the previously mentioned Lady Blackbird game with the dragon is a pretty good 'no blorb is good too' example. The game wasn't gelling, the laid-out setpiece wasn't really going anywhere. So, the GM pulls a dragon out, and boom - everyone is enthused and really into it. That kind of spontaneity and ability to react to the situation at hand with whatever inspires you as you go is powerful. I don't think the players' reaction to finding out that there's no myth there afterwards is especially relevant to how good the play was - that's just them being ignorant of the game - but with a clued-in group that wouldn't matter.<br/><br/>Games like Lady Blackbird work well because they give you enough preprepared stuff to springboard off and a narrow enough scenario that you don't get lost, but the implementation details are up the players/GM. The GM bounces off the players, takes their input, and outputs something that's highly tailored to what they want to do. <br/><br/>There are narrativist games that I think would be improved by blorb as well. Off the cuff - the ones that would be improved by it are games where NPCs have an independent mechanical existence (stats, I guess), or where the solidity of the setting is important. Poison'd is the first thing that comes to mind, and I've run it enough times to know that my make-it-up-as-you-go approach generally doesn't improve things.<br/><br/>More freewheeling games are fine without this - having the GM freely incorporating ideas they crib from the players and reintegrating stuff that comes up offhand is a powerful technique.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484735/#Comment_484735" name="Item_211" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-30T21:39:51+00:00" title="May 30, 2019  9:39PM">May 30</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2019 4:48AM by Paul_T.">edited May 31</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>I know the burden of proof was initially on me for making such a bold statement: \u201call games that tread on the toes of blorb need to be blorb (games that, by being sufficiently hippie have ensured that they don\u2019t look or feel blorby don\u2019t need to be blorby)\u201d.</p><p>But I\u2019ve given plenty of reasons for why I think that.</p></div></blockquote>\nOk!

I think we've been covering a lot of them in these conversations, but I can reference a few. I think <a href="/forums/profile/DeReel">@DeReel</a> basically has it, in their rather more pithy statement, above, but we can expand:<br/><br/>* The example of "the NPC to create drama" Jay described is a good one. There's nothing at all blorby about either a) making sure there's always an NPC around who could create drama, nor b) using that NPC to create drama whenever it's needed.<br/><br/>The benefits over strict blorb seem pretty obvious, too: there is always tension and drama, and the GM can "steer" things more in that direction, to create more exciting play for the players.<br/><br/>* I mentioned the thought experiment of a version of Apocalypse World where all the "choose from a list" moves and options were randomized instead. Isn't it obvious how that would harm the game and make it worse? (It is to me; we can discuss it more if someone finds it not so.)<br/><br/>* The "ice moon" scenario, and similar frustrating experiences (TPKs, for instance) never need happen, because we can always improvise/create new material to keep the game and the story moving. (I'm fairly confident at this point that someone like Cary would have improvised something interesting on the ice moon, had that been his game, and we would have had several hours of exciting, engaging play, instead of sitting around being angry at each other.)<br/><br/>And a new one, which is huge:<br/><br/>* Working with principled prep and consistent resolution methods means that we need to, by definition, treat similar qualities and quantities the same. We can't, for example, resolve one instance of trap-finding one way and another one a different way, simply because we're not interested, the GM has a cool idea, or it's late at night.<br/><br/>If you drop that restriction, you can zoom in and out much more freely, to create tension, drama, excitement, and to follow your interests as players and as a group. You can get straight to the stuff that interests everyone, and spend more of your playtime focused on that.<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>In something like 2097e, when you come to a small town looking for a particular person, we might have a procedure to follow for whether we find them or not. We might end up dicing it out only to find that, no, you don't find them, or play through interactions with other characters, while we try to puzzle out their identity. It's exciting and it challenges the players, but there is lots of room for "dead air", wasting time, or anticlimactic resolution.<br/><br/>In a game like AW, the MC has the tools to offer the PCs an interesting dilemma instead ("offer an opportunity with strings attached", or something like that) and then frame an exciting and dramatic scene with that person, set up to maximize the potential for interesting interactions, danger, romance, and thematic weight.

You don't waste time fighting filler monsters or undertaking routine tasks for the sake of fairness or internal consistency. Most of us get feed on stories constantly and have a gut feel for dramatic moments, and that's what many of us appreciate in a game. Could I play 20 sessions until a character survives long enough for a story to develop and a climax to build up, purely for diegetic reasons? Not very likely. The epic campaigns I've had in 10-12 sessions, sometimes even less, with DW, BW or AW would undertake many more sessions with blorby play.<br/><br/>Me other argument is that roleplaying is telling stories around a campfire, with rules. Many of us instinctively know that this is all made up in the spot, that no SIS exists prior to the act of play. The game and the world and the story are the words we speak. Thus, games operate on a narrative logic where different rules dictate what we may or may not accept as a valid outcome. Here, it's all about narrative and even this focus on blorby content is a narrative genre. So, applying narrative rules like moves isn't "arbitrary", it's in fact quite consistent when well executed, because we all have a sense for climax, pacing, spotlight, drama, etc. It is a style to be practiced and refined as much as the discipline required to GM a blorby game. And the effects of perfectly nailing the scene towards which the tension's been building is perfectly evident in players' reactions.<br/>I'd argue that players need discipline even when they mostly play their characters in story games. I've had players ignore baits for flags they had stated, portray their characters in weird ways they can't justify. So even in traditional story now games, players have a HUGE responsibility if they want a great campaign to unfold, so that's already a big difference with other traditional games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" title="Silmenume"><img alt="Silmenume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">Silmenume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484747/#Comment_484747" name="Item_214" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T05:18:57+00:00" title="May 31, 2019  5:18AM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Sandra,\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenune">@Silmenune</a> - I'm sure this is obvious to anyone whose read any of my AP posts, we don't play a Klockwerk game.

Kinda the biggest problem I had with <abbr title="Burning Wheel">BW</abbr>/ Mouse Guard. Yes it was sad that our mouse friend died but the GM kinda made that happen by putting that bird in our path. It wasn\u2019t a <em>real</em> bird. The good part of the game was tryna play our characters to the hilt, play to our beliefs and such.</p><p>I\u2019ve sometimes pejoratively thought the same thing about the worst of the \u201cadventure paths\u201d:</p><p>In the context of Robin\u2019s Laws player types <small>(yes I know the later book he did for WotC added \u201cinstigator\u201d and a few more)</small>, a big flaw of those types were that they all presupposed playing along with the railroad.

The players, however, have full trust in his ability to make the right call and therefore sort of "assume" that there is always logic behind what is being said and played. A sort of mild self-deception.<br/><br/>In the meantime, the concept of "Mythic Bricolage" lays the groundwork for celebrating that kind of ambiguity instead of seeing it as "rule-breaking".<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484761/#Comment_484761" name="Item_224" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T06:15:36+00:00" title="May 31, 2019  6:15AM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" rel="nofollow">Thanuir</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I think your other points are solid, but this one might benefit from some examples and elaboration.</p></div></blockquote>\nTrue.

The very fact that Esmeralda turning into a vampire is very unlikely means that it's <i>so much more meaningful</i>.<br/><br/>However, for a group that doesn't value the objectivity as much, the advantage is precisely the inverse: that this cool moment - Esmeralda turning into a vampire - can happen pretty much every time they play.<br/><br/>They don't have to wait through ten sessions where Esmeralda <i>doesn't</i> turn into a vampire. They can effectively "fast forward" to the moment where she does, and play that out.<br/><br/>They're trading off <i>frequency and consistency</i> of "cool moments!" for the <i>impact</i> of those cool moments. Kind of a quality vs. quantity thing, I suppose, to put it crudely.<br/><br/>But then if you imagine that the ability to <i>come up with those moments</i> is the skill the players want to use as often as possible, non-blorby play gives them far more opportunities to do so.<br/><br/>In one case it's a rare thing that only happens when the gloracle wills it. In the other, you've removed the gloracle so that you can do it all the time, at every session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" title="Silmenume"><img alt="Silmenume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">Silmenume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484763/#Comment_484763" name="Item_226" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T06:26:39+00:00" title="May 31, 2019  6:26AM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Sandra, <br/><br/>I said that only a small percentage of new players make the cut.

It's a tradeoff, though, with all the other things I'm listing. Some people like it and some people don't! I can see the appeal of both sides, frankly (as you know, I'm a big fan of "blorb" and principled prep; I just wouldn't use it in this style of gaming, where it will just get in the way of the fun).<br/><br/>So, then, where does the drama come from? You describe it well here:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>That is the bigges strike <em>for</em> blorb of all time though.

Only tell a story <em>about</em> tension, drama or excitement.</p></div></blockquote>\nYou are so right!<br/><br/>So, then, why doesn't everyone do that?<br/><br/>1. Some people really don't want to "create real tension". They very much want to "tell a story about tension, drama, or excitement". That's more fun for them. They don't like the real tension; they like the storytelling. <br/><br/>It's a different kind of pleasure. I enjoy it sometimes. A lot.<br/><br/>2. However! Non-blorby games can still totally have real tension, drama and excitement. My favourite kind of non-blorby game has strict and solid, tangible resolution mechanics for what happens next, which puts very real stakes on the line.<br/><br/>An easy example is any game which allows you to stake your character's life on a particular instance of conflict resolution. (You've played Dogs, you said: that's a game that does this well. You can always choose to "give" in a conflict if you don't want to take more fallout. This means that your life is never on the line except when you choose it to be... and <i>that</i> becomes the rare, impactful, powerful, memorable thing, instead. Except it's based on pure player choice instead of random gloracular outcomes. In this sense, it's more pure; it happened because it was that important to you, not because the dice happened to fall that way this one time.)<br/><br/>Much like how those anticlimactic moments in "blorby" play make it even better, as you wrote earlier:<br/><br/>"The possibility for anticlimactic resolution makes climactic resolutions awesomer."<br/><br/>The version of that in Dogs is something like:<br/><br/>"The possibility of folding in any conflict means that those times when you <i>do</i> choose to risk your life for something you care about, it really <i>means something</i>."<br/><br/>That's a form of drama and excitement that's really tangible and really cool, and doesn't rely on blorb or prep in any meaningful way.<br/><br/>It's also super intense and super fun!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484771/#Comment_484771" name="Item_229" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T06:51:53+00:00" title="May 31, 2019  6:51AM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not to be contrarian, but I don't personally feel like you can have real tension because of the inherent fictional nature of the events.

It's just a matter of how you present that fabrication, and personal preference. The stakes and tension you buy into will always feel more real to you than the ones you don't buy into. Blorb isn't inherently any more real. It's just what you buy into the most. And like, this is coming from a place of that I've played blorb games, and I'm not the type who buys in that kind of way. They were the most artificial thing imaginable to me. It didn't feel at all like life. It felt like a computer simulation at best to me. <br/>And yeah. Just something to think about on the topic of "real" vs. "not real".

But they make a *terrible* protagonist in an "action movie" kind of story, and same goes for a romantic comedy.<br/><br/>Removing certain elements of "blorb" and allowing a more freewheeling approach can really free up players to play characters who are interesting and don't make "optimal" choices, which are often the most interesting characters in our favourite stories.<br/><br/>That can have quite an impact on games, as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484783/#Comment_484783" name="Item_238" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T07:35:43+00:00" title="May 31, 2019  7:35AM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2019 7:37AM by Paul_T.">edited May 31</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>You misunderstood what I meant.

You'll have to explain that, then, because I don't know how you'd do that.<br/><br/>In blorb play, you can often end up in a situation (to continue the metaphor) where there is no longer an NPC around to create drama.

I'd have to think about that.)<br/><br/>But a game can have all kinds of traditional elements but not "full blorb". Sorcerer and Apocalypse World (or whatever; pick your own example!) have a traditional player/GM split and all that but don't include mechanics for "getting lost on an ice moon". (And I would argue that it's because the designers were well aware of this potential pitfall and designed smartly around it.)\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>answer two is that blorb isn\u2019t being taught.

It requires time, attention, constant tweaking (rulings, updating prepped material, etc), discipline, lots of trial and error, course correcting, and so on.<br/><br/>You do well because you clearly put a lot of time and effort and thought into it. For some people, it's very impractical (maybe they have no time to prep at all; maybe they have a learning disability - whatever).<br/><br/>It's not an "easy" approach; some other, looser approaches are much more practical for people.

It's simply an example, first of all - there are many such forms of "tangibility" in non-blorby games, and, for me, at least, Narrativist play depends pretty heavily on them. <br/><br/>But, more importantly, the dynamic I described wouldn't be any less true in a game that didn't have prep but used Dogs mechanics. The fact that the GM is expected to prep a Town doesn't change that fact. (It occurs in other ways in Apocalypse World, for instance, even in the first session. And, in theory, it could come into play in an initiation conflict in Dogs, too, which is explicitly unprepped in any way.) <br/><br/>The prep here is a total red herring; the key is that all kinds of interactions in play can result in tension, drama, and uncertainty. Sticking to principled prep is just one of many ways to achieve that (and, for many people, a highly unreliable way to get there, depending on what they value or care about).<br/><br/>(Remember <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20681/burned-at-the-stake-rpg-ruleset-for-passionate-characters-at-risk" rel="nofollow">these rules</a>, for example?

I am eager to transfer the concepts I'm gleaning to my forum-resistant group and having evocative terms helps.<br/><br/>I would say my two preferred styles of play are:<br/><br/>a) No-prep (not counting day-dreaming or aesthetic prep), cut right to the drama, frame every scene around a core theme or premise. (I call this Narrativist but I know that's a loaded term).  Kingdom, Follow, and my fav PbtAs (AW and Masks) do this well.<br/><br/>b) High-prep, what's on the page can't be changed (I mostly run adventure sites by <a href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">@Fuseboy</a>, <a href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">@Thor_O</a>, etc ), pacing is baked into the rule-set, follow the players around and adjudicate as transparently and consistently as possible.<br/><br/>These are both fun for totally different reasons.  I love the feeling of "getting it right" by adding in a plausible, well-foreshadowed twist in a system where you have the leeway to introduce new elements freely.  I also love when my hand is off the wheel (like the randomly rolled vampire hunter-turned vampire) and happen to get a satisfying result.  In the latter example (Klockwork), the core gameplay loop needs to be fun, satisfying enough that I'm not drumming my fingers waiting for an emergent plot development that might never get rolled.<br/><br/>I have played some systems that are designed for relatively Klockwork play (not in it's platonic form, but there are degrees) and I like them a lot less when they GM takes a tighter rein over events.<br/><br/>For example, Torchbearer is my go-to system for this kind of play.  However, it sometimes falls pretty far short of this bar.<br/><br/>In one scenario, the GM has a map of dungeons prepped and says "Here are the travel rules.  Go for it."  It's totally up to the players which dungeons they engage with, when they retreat to town, how they address the threats at each location, etc.  This allows for nearly full-Klockwork play.  They risks and rewards are tangible and the GM has no tools for steering them in one direction or another.<br/><br/>In another scenario, the GM shows up each week with a dungeon prepped and tells the players how they get hooked into the adventure.  I often end up playing in this mode; it's the only way to playtest an adventure site on a reasonable timeline, or run for only a couple of sessions without wasting prep.  The Klockwork factor here is way lower.  It still works, and the players have plenty of leeway in the environment (there's no hard-scene framing by the GM after the adventure is started) but it's a significant difference.<br/><br/>My other example is complex enough that I am going to make a new thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484797/#Comment_484797" name="Item_247" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T12:57:14+00:00" title="May 31, 2019 12:57PM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2019 1:02PM by DeReel.">edited May 31</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good workshoping going on and I've missed so much. A bit metaphysical at times (the reality of fiction etc.) ;p <br/>Simulating a world or a story genre, the random generator of dramatic incidients, all this reminds me of Spinozza's physics : there are things and the relations between things, which are a sort of thing in their own way. This kind of distinction really benefits from being cleanly built from the ground up. Else, we navigate between clouds and dice but without knowing where the interlocutor is.<br/><br/>I want to emphasis a point : that you can (and I'd argue it's always the case) have the whole table merely move air only half heartedly, and then a ping pong ball could float on that air stream, and that's when things begin to feel real. I like a good "(fishing line) plunger" mechanic to detect this moment, Rickard's postural vote in Imagine being my model at the moment. There's no more reality before than after. It's called intensity, and it's common to take it for truth or reality, because it's really convincing. "Intensity" meaning is wider than "fun" (a useful distinction when talking about character death).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484811/#Comment_484811" name="Item_248" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T16:23:24+00:00" title="May 31, 2019  4:23PM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2019 4:28PM by 2097.">edited May 31</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p><a href="/forums/profile/moconnor">@moconnor</a>, we might be pretty much on the same page</p><p><a href="/forums/profile/Khimus%E2%80%A6">@Khimus\u2026</a></p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Khimus" rel="nofollow">Khimus</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Khimus" rel="nofollow">Khimus</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>there\u2019s nothing routine about fighting a monster that can kill you or making sure you don\u2019t rack up too many starvation days that can kill you.</p></div></blockquote><p>Sandra, if you can\u2019t concede that:</p><ol><li>Some people aren\u2019t interested in random encounters.</li><li>Fighting to death every fight for no reason is not interesting in every genre.

other than as a metaphor, the act of roleplaying is not a trip, but a collective narration, right? Not talking about agendas and any of that stuff, but of the social act of playing. If an anthropologist were to observe us while we play, he wouldn't say we're having a trip.<br/>So, for me, talking about genres is actually more pertinent in my opinion. And that is the blindness I don't like in the sandbox movement.

This was a wilderness exploration game with an open table, two GM's, multiple games per week, etc.  I played in a dozen sessions out of around 50.<br/><br/>This game was in "full-blorb" mode.  My friend and the other GM prepared everything extensively and shared all their notes to keep things consistent.  They made a bunch of changes to the moves and playbooks of Dungeon World to remove anything that involved making things up on the spot, and though I did not see the GM-side rules, it's my understanding that they also added more detailed rules and guidelines to the game about which moves could be used in which circumstances, in order to ensure the world worked consistently when switching GM's.<br/><br/>From my point of view the underlying consistency / prep / no-fudge attitude was obvious.  Telltale signs included (as Paul would predict) occasional boring sessions where we went out exploring somewhere and didn't find much of anything, and the occasional player death due to bad decisions and bad dice rolls.  This was very much what I had signed up for and I thought it was obvious that this was what the game was going to be like from the GMs' pitch.<br/><br/>However, there were other players who had a very hard time accepting the fact that the GM would not contradict his rules or prep.  This was especially the case with experienced Dungeon World players.  There was one player who was always at odds with the GM, trying to insert his own ideas or getting frustrated when his solution to a problem was foiled by the hidden parameters of the problem.  There were one or two other players who blamed the GM when their character died (although they had gone into an obviously dangerous area and performed obviously dangerous actions).  And there was somebody else who complained the GM used the "deal damage" move too often in combat, rather than offering them interesting choices.  Several of these players quit the game in frustration.<br/><br/>So, this game was a case where the presence of a game with non-traditional mechanics (Dungeon World) caused (some) players to have the wrong "anti-blorb" expectations.  Basically the opposite problem to the one this thread has been talking about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484822/#Comment_484822" name="Item_256" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T17:40:28+00:00" title="May 31, 2019  5:40PM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's also a big level for me where my intent inherent lack of buy-in to blorb is a product of how strongly I'm against worldbuilding in fiction.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484824/#Comment_484824" name="Item_257" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T17:47:18+00:00" title="May 31, 2019  5:47PM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (BTW before I dig into these new replies I want to add something)<br/><br/>I am aware that "I used to believe what you folx believe but now I my position is this complete opposite thing" doesn't mean that I am right and isn't a valid line of <i>argument</i> or <i>reason</i> or whatever.<br/><br/>All it <i>does</i> mean is that "I don't believe X" isn't a good argument from y'all since I used to not believe X either so I don't put a lot of stock into not believing X in-and-of-itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484825/#Comment_484825" name="Item_258" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T17:54:17+00:00" title="May 31, 2019  5:54PM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" rel="nofollow">EmmatheExcrucian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>There\u2019s nothing wrong with \u2018narrativium\u2019.

Like I mentioned the GM's had some additional rules and procedures that they were using that were not player-facing.  (That was part of the premise of the game--you are exploring a mysterious world, you don't know its rules, can you figure them out and use them to survive?

The players upset about dying may have been used to GM's fudging results to save their beloved characters.<br/><br/>I can't give a completely certain answer since it was a few years ago, and it is about the expectations of other people who are not me, and I heard about some of these complaints and conflicts second-hand from the GM.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I should mention that the majority of the players did understand and accept the blorby (clockwork?  that's a good word for it) nature of the game.\n<blockquote>I\u2019m learning about Freebooters of the Frontier which seems to be more of a blorby take on DW?</blockquote>\nI think the GM in this game mentioned he had looked into that but found it was designed more for randomly generated wilderness adventures than for the full Ben Robbins deep history approach.

Perhaps it will help someone! <br/><br/>1. In Sandra's style of gaming, there is an agreed upon method (all the gloracle, prep, procedures of play, and GM style/technique) which serves as the "foundation" for play. It's consistent and solid and players know what to expect. This lends a tremendous "solidity" or "tangibility" to play which is enjoyable, and makes things feel more "real".<br/><br/>2. Some people don't care about solidity and tangibility and just want to tell stories in a freewheeling way. That's cool, too, but it's not what we're focusing on here. (In this style of gaming, we trust the players' judgement to make choices matter, instead of the procedural mechanics; instead of saying "here's a format for making choices matter", we say, "I trust each of us to make each others' choices matter by taking them into account as we create story". Just like "bad blorb" play, this can fail, but it can also work.)<br/><br/>3. In Narrativist play that seeks to feel real and solid, though, how does that work? Much like all the klockwerk which underlies 2097e, we need a solid foundation which grounds the game and makes choices matter. It's consistency of player roles, advocacy for characters, and consistent, principled resolution. I trust that you will play my opponent to the hilt, and fairly, while we have pre-established rules for how they interact and how we find out who "wins" or how it all turns out. We don't need to prep distances on a map, traps, or combat stats, because the conflicts we're interested in don't concern those things. We don't need rules for getting stranded on ice moons, but we <i>do</i> need rules for what it means when your character is willing to lose their life to stop mine from doing what he wants to do (for a simple example; each game will be different).<br/><br/>Once we establish the groundwork for these conflicts and solid, consistent methods for resolving them, we get emergent outcomes and exciting "real" play, just like with blorb methods.<br/><br/>(GM-as-storyteller, 90s play fails on both counts: first, the GM doesn't necessarily lay the groundwork for conflicts and stick to it, and, second, the methods for resolving them are either not consistently applied or hopelessly obscured. So this is very distinct from that.)<br/><br/>In those conversations about "what differentiates AW from traditional play", we talked about quite a few of these things. Unlike GM-mediated task resolution, which is famously open to interpretation and "cheating" (like the classic case of the GM asking for more and more rolls until you succeed), AW has all kinds of rules and procedures which produce solid, tangible outcomes we can't cheat around.<br/><br/>Good examples include that a) NPCs don't and can't arbitrarily have different numbers of hit points, and b) certain moves guarantee the PCs can hurt them reliably (so no NPC can be bulletproof), c) all kinds of moves guarantee players access to reliable and important information (like the reading moves, deep brain scan, and many others), and d) many rules and moves simply give the players the ability to create and state immutable facts about what things are and what they mean: for example, an advanced seduce/manipulate allows you to make any NPC into an "ally".<br/><br/>Those rules and restrictions all work with each other to produce emergent, tangible outcomes in a way that you don't get in "90s GM as storyteller" games. They are real and unexpected and lasting.<br/><br/>All of these design elements work against murky, unclear play, and ruin the possibility of a railroading GM trying to create the story they want. Add the explicit principles of play and play culture surrounding the thing, and you get something which is very, very distinct from 90s trad games, despite having lots of similarities at a level of procedures and techniques.<br/><br/>It's a nice middle ground between total No Myth and "full blorb", and it's a really fun and popular way to play. <br/><br/>You can get similar play from even more traditional rulesets if the GM is able and willing to adopt a strict and principled approach to how they create and adjudicate situations. This can look nothing like "blorb", but is similar in that it can be an objective and consistent, principled means of creating opposition and conflict which makes everything in play feel "more real".<br/><br/>In short, Sandra's objections about "non-blorb" play degenerating into 90s-style "GM moves the goalposts" nonsense are not entirely wrong (that can totally happen!), but they're trying to paint in black and white what is actually a wide spectrum that has so many different positions for a variety of fun and cool play, in different shades of grey.<br/><br/>(Again, Critical Role is a pretty fun example, in some ways. I see no reason to think that it's full-on "railroaded", linear play, but it has elements that are incredibly anti-blorby. Despite that, people clearly are enjoying themselves a lot. It's far less principled in this sense than AW, but neither is it "blorby", and certainly isn't a morass of horrible "GM moves the goalposts" nonsense which doesn't seem real to anyone. I see no reason to assume that if it was made "more blorby", the participants would enjoy the game more. Same goes for Cary's game. It would be a tradeoff, in both cases. They would gain some things and lose others - others that they really value.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484885/#Comment_484885" name="Item_291" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T22:47:30+00:00" title="May 31, 2019 10:47PM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Khimus" rel="nofollow">Khimus</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>A question for the blob-people:</p></div></blockquote><p>Please try to be kinder\u2665<br/>I\u2019m already bummed out enough<img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/></p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Khimus" rel="nofollow">Khimus</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>How do you deal with players bored or uninterested?

I usually just lurk, so this feels sorta awkward.<br/><br/>I share 2097s view that playing ttrpgs blorbily is very different from telling a story (or reading a story for that matter). It's still fiction, but the way I'm interacting with it is very different. <br/><br/>I remember my first contact with ttrpg "realness" and I think it's an interesting datapoint, because its almost the opposite of the mirror story.<br/><br/>We played DoD Chronopia, a truly unblorby 90s style game. The GM admitted to changing the stats of some soldiers once to save our lives. <br/><br/>Me and another player were escaping a dungeon. We'd been kidnapped by an unknown organisation and I figured we'd find some explanation of who they were and why we were there. We pretty soon came to a room with several doors (the GM painstakingly drew it up for us) and we opened one and anti-climactically found ourself out in the city once again. <br/><br/>It was a worthless story. The prepped map and our choices had been respected to the detriment of "excitement" - and I was thrilled! That dungeon was a real place with doors that opened up to rooms that we'd never see. It didn't have a satisfying narrative arc - and it felt like real life. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484891/#Comment_484891" name="Item_296" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-01T00:19:12+00:00" title="June  1, 2019 12:19AM">June 1</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2019 12:21AM by AsIf.">edited June 1</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Khimus" rel="nofollow">Khimus</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><blockquote>The invented dragon in AsIf\u2019s Lady Blackbird game.</blockquote></div></blockquote>\nOk, that's an interesting example. What I read here is the players were unclear on what the principles of this style of gaming were.<br/><br/>I'm late to the party, but what happened there was everyone except for one player being thrilled with the improved nature of the solution, while that other player was not.  So that's really a case of differing views within the group itself.  Just to clarify.  I'll go as far as to say that his previous experiences with other, more prepped games brought him to the table with a specific set of expectations that weren't Blackbirdesque.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Khimus" title="Khimus"><img alt="Khimus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Khimus">Khimus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484892/#Comment_484892" name="Item_297" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-01T00:26:31+00:00" title="June  1, 2019 12:26AM">June 1</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph" rel="nofollow">Jeph</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>So let's say we're playing Air Chess.<br/><br/>Air Chess is exactly like normal chess, but there's no physical board or game pieces.

Every step further you make away from chess rules makes it look more and more like fiction, and those awkward restrictions at how players signal their actions end up being a collective narration. For instance, if you were to explain the game to me like this, I'd instantly suggest dropping the names rule and having the board visible to everybody. Why use that, if this isn't fiction? I don't intent stories while playing settlers of Catan, it's a waste of time.<br/>I'd rather ground the discussion in actual play experiences.<br/>Take the standpoint of an external observer. He didn't read that over complicated explanation. He's just exposed to what they're saying and doing. He hears your example:   "Alice from Village of Homlett to Cave of the Blue Medusa," you say, "Alice walks from Homlett to the Cave," and I say, "They're two miles apart, so that'll take about 40 minutes. In that time, the water pouring into the cave rises another foot and a half."<br/>What is it, from a linguistical perspective? A narration. It's oral, shared, and participation is limited by rules. Is it a game, too? It has some elements common to games, but rules can fluctuate a lot ("physics") and there's no clear winning condition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484896/#Comment_484896" name="Item_298" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-01T05:05:26+00:00" title="June  1, 2019  5:05AM">June 1</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<small>Note to self if I ever get reincarnated: semantics worst degree of all time</small><br/><br/>\u2665Flanellis!!\u2665\u2665 My friend!<br/>Did you read the whole thread?

It's possible that you just designed a boring scenario or dungeon and players don't seem too engaged in terms of fun, even if they're invested in it because of their characters' goals. So they won't just go do something else.</p></div></blockquote>\nWe just had a talk at the end of previous session during which touched two points: The first is for players to take initiative if they want more to happen, and the second is for me to be more streamlined when they are approaching a dangerous location.<br/><br/>I have not really faced the situation you specifically ask about. I guess the core game of D&amp;D of going into dangerous situations and trying to survive is fun and interesting enough. A couple of times when the players did not really know what they were on about they just went into a nearby dungeon and did some basic dungeoncrawling. These expeditions often affect wider events, in turn, and make them more meaningful. For example, a goblin tribe deserting the dungeon and swearing vengeance, or a respected member of a bandit group being humiliated and losing status, to take two recent examples.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484904/#Comment_484904" name="Item_305" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-01T07:11:39+00:00" title="June  1, 2019  7:11AM">June 1</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" rel="nofollow">Thanuir</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The first is for players to take initiative if they want more to happen</p></div></blockquote>\nI've good experience with getting those kinda talks to actually work\u2665<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484905/#Comment_484905" name="Item_306" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-01T07:12:51+00:00" title="June  1, 2019  7:12AM">June 1</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the infinite chess board example has a point, but I would start elsewhere.<br/><br/>Nowadays there are several fantasy adventure board games with miniatures. Heroquest is the old classic and I am not familiar with the new ones. Descent, maybe?<br/><br/>I played through a tutorial of one of them with a friend. I had a hero figure I moved through a short corridor and there were skeletons coming from front and back. Maybe some timer. Thinking about it as a roleplayer, the first question was if I could jump over or run through the skeletons in front of me, rather than the long slog of rolling dice to kill them. The game did not have rules for this, so no.<br/><br/>What if I wanted a similar experience, but where I could jump over or sneak past the skeletons or crush them by toppling a pillar on top of them and so on? That is what OSR play gives to me, though the fact that social situations and interaction are also part of it is very important. (That is, the domain of play or game arena includes social interaction with non-player characters.)<br/><br/>Maybe this is relevant to the storytelling discussion; I have to admit to not being quite sure how it relates to the interesting claim of Sandra.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484906/#Comment_484906" name="Item_307" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-01T07:19:24+00:00" title="June  1, 2019  7:19AM">June 1</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" rel="nofollow">Thanuir</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>the fact that social situations and interaction are also part of it is very important.

Explain please the need for names to places and characters and "physics" for a board game.

I guess it depends on how exactly one interprets "90s game", but I feel it's pretty clearly being used around here as shorthand for something like a game that presents itself as blorb (to make all those best moments feel real) while using plenty of no-myth behind the scenes (to avoid slow deaths on icy moons and make sure those best moments come quickly and often). Which is deceptive by definition and incoherent by definition.<br/><br/>Actually, maybe it's incoherent only if you value blorb, or value no-myth? If both are subordinate to a third goal, then maybe mixing them and compromising both isn't incoherent at all? See Silmenume's game.<br/><br/>In fact, my experience has been that for a lot of people who come into RPGs, this is the default preference.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The big thing is that <strong>the blorb experience requires the five traditional techinques to work</strong>:</p><ul><li>information separation</li><li>resolution mechanics</li><li>each player character is only being run by one player each</li><li>identifying stance</li><li>GM plays world</li></ul><p>You need them to have blorb.

"Draw maps, leave blanks" is <i>exactly</i> what I love most of the time in RPGs.<br/><br/>There are a few key elements that need to be in place to make half-Myth work (just as for any other level of Myth). First off, obviously, the stuff that is pre-prepped can't just be ignored willy-nilly (for the sake of "story" or whatever). Second, you need to have some sort of veto process whereby people can't contradict that which has been introduced before. Essentially, you need good improv rules (this is true for no-Myth as well). When players author new facts about the setting, they have to <i>f e e l  r i g h t</i> for that world or story or for those characters.<br/><br/>One time when I was running my Burning Wheel Three Musketeers Scenario (a solidly half-Myth scenario in a solidly half-Myth game engine), two of the players created an NPC Spanish swordsman named Inigo. He was co-created by two players because he was a low-ranking guy that both the manipulative Baron and his seductive daughter were trying to use as a spy. He hadn't "existed" before the contested Circles roll that brought him forth. However, because characters like that fit so well with the genre, it was no problem for anyone's sense of immersion. Furthemore, Inigo's presence didn't undermine any of the Myth elements that are present in that scenario.<br/><br/>Now, here's the even trickier thing. You have to have an organizing principle for play that is <b>orthogonal</b> to blorb concerns. BW's principle of "fight for what you Believe" actually needs amount of both blorb and anti-blorb to really hum. There's no way to go full Myth with BW: it would rob players of too much agency, their characters of too much protagonism. But going full no-Myth is also impossible, except maybe in an initial session where you're all collaboratively establishing the conflicts and the setting. Full no-Myth is too... airy... for what BW is trying to do. (If you don't like BW, I'd say MLwM is similar.)<br/><br/>So, in the case of a well-constructed half-Myth game, what you have is not some failure to pursue an opportunity for blorb. Nor is it a full-on hippie game, though! (Those are cool, to be clear!) I never really realized before this thread just how crucial half-Myth is to making certain games work. Maybe it needs its own thread?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484960/#Comment_484960" name="Item_328" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-02T04:00:33+00:00" title="June  2, 2019  4:00AM">June 2</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2019 4:03AM by Paul_T.">edited June 2</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent, Matt (Deliverator).<br/><br/>I\u2019ve been trying to get at that for some time in this thread, but you said it in perhaps a much clearer way than my attempts so far.<br/><br/>I consider \u201chalf-Myth\u201d (or whatever we want to call it*) to be a really key and important playstyle and super fun as well as tremendously functional.<br/><br/>It\u2019s extremely popular among a new generation of gamers and they play it REALLY well.<br/><br/>As usual in these discussions, I find the laser focus on Technical concerns to be distracting us from the \u201cwhy\u201d or guiding principles behind play itself. \u201cFull blorb\u201d or \u201cfull Myth\u201d are somewhat illusory anyway, best seen as platonic ideals we as humans will never reach (and I don\u2019t think it would produce functional gaming even if we could!).<br/><br/>Any of these techniques can be used successfully when they are employed in the right ends (the proper creative goals), and any of them can totally suck when they are not guided by a clear idea of what role they\u2019re serving in the game (as in my ice moon story, which is as rigorously blorby as anything out there but absolutely miserable gaming).<br/><br/><br/>*: I\u2019m not sure I see this label as representing a meaningful category of game techniques, rather than just describing something that\u2019s not either of the other two types of game we\u2019re talking about, which we\u2019ve been referring to as something like \u201cfull blorb\u201d and \u201c90s Rule Zero GM storytelling\u201d.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484963/#Comment_484963" name="Item_329" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-02T05:03:51+00:00" title="June  2, 2019  5:03AM">June 2</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pretty much nodding along in agreement to that whole post, Paul.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484964/#Comment_484964" name="Item_330" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-02T05:40:05+00:00" title="June  2, 2019  5:40AM">June 2</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Lots of replies while it was night here in Europia!

But who knows, right? It\u2019s cool that cutting edge game design is going on. Like a war game dork in the 90\u2019s being all like \u201chex, counters, tables in books etc are necessary for a war game\u201d and the now people are like \u201cbut semantics on cards that you can shuffle up though?\u201d</p><p>What I\u2019m saying is that these five techniques are tools you use for blorb. If you have \u2019em, do blorb, blorb\u2019s awesome. If you\u2019re not doing blorb, no need to do be shackled down to all five these techniques.</p><p>Can you do blorb w/o these five techniques?

That\u2019s a consequence of my claims and radical enough to qualify as a claim in and of itself.</p><p>Before \u201cmirror story\u201d, I had played in extremely \u201cimmersive\u201d games (on the surface level) in the past. No dice, no out-of-character talk, no numbers, just narration in character in the dark. All diegesis all the time.</p><p>With the mirror story the game felt orders of magnitude more real. A thousand times more!</p><p>It\u2019s sorta like this guy\u2019s video (which came out like three years after than my \u201cmirror story\u201d experience):</p><p>Immersion\u2026 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xncs1mrMV6o" rel="nofollow">this video is a pretty good summary of a bunch of theories from other fields [video games] on immersion</a>; I disagree completely with that guy\u2019s <em>other</em> videos but that video is pretty good! Emma our resident immersion hater might dig it\u2665</p><p>What he is talking about is how solid mechanics are more appealing than realistic graphics.</p><p>By the time that video came out I had already split immersion up into two types myself: \u201cbuy-in immersion\u201d and \u201cstance immersion\u201d [sometimes I\u2019ve called that \u201c\u2018mood\u2019 immersion\u201d]. (Because 2097e is an in-person game and not a video game.)</p><p>Transparency of method increases buy-in [regardless of blorb presence\u2026 just knowing <em>how the game is set up</em> helps you buy into the stakes and premises] but distracts from stance immersion. I\u2019ve been thinking of making some sorta verifiable game record behind-the-screen app so you can postpone all the transparency of method to <em>after</em> the session. No more \u201croll a twenty-sided\u201d, instead we get all the benefits of my olden candle-lit days but with also having all the benefits of the actual gloracle. Maybe such a game would\u2019ve benefited from being simpler than D&amp;D 5e with its litany of spells and maneuvers and class features.</p><p>I was hoping to run Cthulhu Dark in a hyper immersive way, because it had simpler mechanics that could handle all cases situations, but I realized that the insight clock in it was kinda fighting against the finchian/lawsian resolution I value. If I were to play it again I\u2019d add in a \u201cbe finchian/lawsian or roll the dice\u201d rule. A \u201clook to Karma before you look to Fortune\u201d rule. Huh, that makes me think that maybe Everway is a better game for this experiment than Cthulhu Dark because it doesn\u2019t have the players making any kind of dice-level choices at all. You do all diegetic level choices and then your stats says what\u2019s happen.</p><p>These days I have better knowledge of IIEE and how to \u201cset up moves\u201d (\u201cthe ogre is drawing back his arms, swinging his fist directly at you, what do you do?\u201d), and better knowledge on how to prep porte-monstre-tr\xe9sor instead of prepping story. Drawing from a deck of shuffled, but selected and familiar, vision cards instead of rolling from an encounter table. Now I want to try this. IDK maybe that\u2019s dumb.

Would this be a satisfactory a rule set?<br/><br/>A random thought: A lot of the classic immersive play (we played for three sessions and only rolled dice twice) is focused on relationships. There is a lot of focus on characters talking to each other about their emotions and relationships. The wider fiction provides context for this, of course, and significant non-player characters there are important, but I would imagine that a much larger part of the game world is more inconsequental than in OSR-type challenge-focused play. Is there less need for a solid fiction in relationship-based play?<br/>An example might be characters organizing a birthday party for one of them and figuring out whom to invite and what kind of decorations and programme to have. Then playing out the party. We might want to know the layout of the building, because it might give creative input due to restrictions of space or force some characters to take more prominent positions during the festivities, but it all is far less important than a dungeon layout. A random encounter table is probably not necessary, though one could be used; a random party accident table might be useful, but I do not see it adding that much when compared to just considering who the characters are and coming up with something based on their personalities and quirks.<br/><br/>Immersive play; is a solid fiction of great importance?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484977/#Comment_484977" name="Item_337" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-02T16:02:57+00:00" title="June  2, 2019  4:02PM">June 2</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2019 4:03PM by 2097.">edited June 2</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" rel="nofollow">Thanuir</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Suppose you have played with the same game master for a while and you trust them so be as neutral an arbiter as possible, and they have a solidly prepared game setting available.

There is a lot of focus on characters talking to each other about their emotions and relationships. The wider fiction provides context for this, of course, and significant non-player characters there are important, but I would imagine that a much larger part of the game world is more inconsequental than in OSR-type challenge-focused play. Is there less need for a solid fiction in relationship-based play? An example might be characters organizing a birthday party for one of them and figuring out whom to invite and what kind of decorations and programme to have. Then playing out the party. We might want to know the layout of the building, because it might give creative input due to restrictions of space or force some characters to take more prominent positions during the festivities, but it all is far less important than a dungeon layout. A random encounter table is probably not necessary, though one could be used; a random party accident table might be useful, but I do not see it adding that much when compared to just considering who the characters are and coming up with something based on their personalities and quirks.</p></div></blockquote><p>Yeah, I\u2019ve written about this upthread:</p><p><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/484682/#Comment_484682" rel="nofollow">\u201creally strong player characters colliding <em>hard</em> against each other in a tight space\u201d</a></p><p><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/484791/#Comment_484791" rel="nofollow">\u201cTension, drama and uncertainty arise from tangible elements (such as player characters) colliding with each other.

First I'm getting confused by the use of "blorb".  In one presentation we have blorb presented as very specific type of game preparation technique.  In another "blorb" is being offered as game construct much like Story is employed in Narrativism.  Finally we have "blorb" being used as a method or process of play.  Is it all the above or one or more or something completely different?<br/><br/>Second - we use <i>all</i> the above bullet points on your list in the game that I play in.  I would like to point to you of a case of non-rpg case of immersion.  When the TV series "The Fugitive" ran in the 60's people used to call the police when they saw the actor David Janssen on the street.  Some members of the audience had so bought in to the fiction aired (immersed) that they failed to make the distinction between fiction and real life.  These were not people who suffered disassociative personality disorders but your average persons.  And they were totally passive in the process.  They were nothing but audience members with absolutely no agency to affect the fiction space.  I understand that watching a TV show and playing an RPG are not the same but my point is that "blorb" was not required to achieve a mental state where people thought the fiction was "real" and "tangible".<br/><br/>"Blorb" might be a valuable technique that works for you and your group and likely many others but it is not the only path to "immersion".<br/><br/>I also in agreement with <a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a> about "half-myth" which is really closer to how we play.  We play in ME but the books did not detail everything square mile of ME.  To just blanket assume that because the books or maps made of ME don't show every detail before play that nothing can ever happen or be in those spaces doesn't follow.  "There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy."<br/><br/>WRT formalizing every possible mechanic I did follow the link to Vincent's blog (lumpley) and noted the following - \n<blockquote>33. On 2008-04-16, Vincent said:<br/>Does formalizing rules rob them of their goodness? Absolutely yes, 100% of the time.<br/><br/>You want formal rules for the places your informal rules don't cover. I've never heard of, and can't imagine, a roleplaying group taking its working informal rules and imposing formality upon them.<br/><br/>I don't know any game designers who've successfully formalized their group's informal rules, either. My groups' informal rules have informed my game design, of course, but for none of my games have I ever just written down what we already do.</blockquote>\nWhile his general gist is that while formal mechanics help push players to unwelcome and unwanted events they also have the drawback of -\n<blockquote>I think it's inevitable that playing by formal rules will mean that some of the things you want to happen in a game, can't. <i>They cut off welcome events, whole domains at a time.</i> That's one of the biggest strengths of freeform play - that's why I say that live negotiation and <i>honest collaboration is more robust and flexible than any given formal ruleset.</i></blockquote>\nI think, though, that his arguments are aimed specifically towards Narrativist play.  In game negotiation of scenes is antithetical to Mythic Bricolage and, I presume, to Challenge based play.<br/><br/>I'll state this again Mythic Bricolage play does have a resolution mechanic - it's called Bricolage and it is not deterministic.  This is the very hang up that most people have with the idea of this mode of play.  Yet real world native tribes use this method to create their cognitive frame of reality.  If real humans beings do this for real purposes that underpin the totality of their cultures then why must it be any less able to create a "tangible, real" game <i>experience</i>?<br/><br/>What "blorb" seems to be is a Social Contract convention between the players and the GM. It is promise between the players that the GM will precreate everything that will happen in the game, will make their note available upon request after the game and not interfere with the Klockwerk.  Great!  It's a technique of play that really jazzes you and your players.  Can't argue with success.  But saying "blorb" is the only or even the best way to immersion is "One True Wayism" and that claim falls apart in light of my own experiences.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485003/#Comment_485003" name="Item_346" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T01:40:32+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  1:40AM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playing a true protagonist in the literary sense is very much the goal of BW and many of its relatives.

You "are" the author rather than the character, but you have one character that is your primary responsibility. There's something that makes me kind of uncomfortable around that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485011/#Comment_485011" name="Item_348" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T05:16:10+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  5:16AM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2019 5:17AM by 2097.">edited June 3</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>About \u201chalf-myth\u201d\u2026 A \u201cno myth\u201d game was defined as a game where things weren\u2019t true until they had been established in play; hadn\u2019t entered the SIS.

The players have one job and are expected to focus on that job: Their characters making actions in the game world.</dd></dl><p>For example, in the game Feng Shui, players are expected to stay out of the identifying stance in order to be able to invent detail about the SIS that matches their character\u2019s intent. \u201cI grab the plates from the table and start hurling them at the orc\u201d <em>without first asking \u201cAre there plates here?\u201d</em></p><p>This is a subversion of, or a hippiefication of, a traditional technique.</p><p>Similarly circles in Burning Wheel, as explained to me by <a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a>, subverts/hippifies all four of these techniques.</p><p>If a game strongly&amp;strictly maintains these four techniques, my understanding was that one of these three things is going on:</p><ul><li>It\u2019s a blorby game and there <em>is</em> a solid gamestate.</li><li>It\u2019s a role division kept out of inertia/tradition rather than necessity</li><li>It\u2019s a participationist game (or possibly illusionist, if it\u2019s being presented as a blorby game, but you\u2019re right, let\u2019s not assume malice and stick with participationist)</li></ul><p>Sometimes the last two points can kind of show up together. There used to be a solid game state, there isn\u2019t anymore, but there\u2019s still this role division.</p><p>I am frustrated/jarred by Burning Wheel because it whips me back &amp; forth between two different modes of play. There is so much in the game normally that puts me into the role division. Scripting my fight actions, making my character from the bottom-up in terms of life paths, hyper-diegetic skill improvement\u2026 so many things make me think \u201cOK I\u2019m the character\u201d but I always have to remember this whole other out-of-stance ability.</p><p>Could you please clarify what the difference between a participationist game and the mythic ME game is?<br/>Participationist games can have \u201cstakes questions\u201d / Kobayashi Maru moments, can\u2019t they?</p><p>I\u2019m sorry for the wonky formatting.

Not because I didn\u2019t get my way but because I thought there should have been a roll.<br/><br/>At the time I blamed all this on the system \u2018It should have been say yes or roll the dice, then I would have got my roll.\u2019<br/><br/>Now I think system is a secondary concern. For the system to even matter in the first place, me and the GM must have been onboard that this was a dramatic moment. That maybe my words would incite the citizens to violence, that we\u2019d decide it with a dice roll.<br/><br/>Whether the mob would riot is a salient point and I wanted us to be in this together in finding out what would happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite" title="AlexanderWhite"><img alt="AlexanderWhite" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite">AlexanderWhite</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485018/#Comment_485018" name="Item_355" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T06:54:57+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  6:54AM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> when you were doing full on 90's style GM stuff.

This is just checking we\u2019re on the same page about fundamentals before we get to prep/information separation. <br/><br/>Imagine two people talking, making stuff up, Bob and Sue. <br/><br/>Bob: A weary traveler<br/>Sue: staggers through a desert<br/>Bob: hungry and pained<br/>Sue: on the horizon a city<br/>and so on: of lapuzi and gold<br/>the traveler shields his eyes against the sun<br/>sees the city and smiles<br/>heads towards it<br/>within the city a callous prince reclines on a couch covered in rarest furs<br/>he rings a bell of glass to summon his favorite concubine<br/>she is there in moments, all smiles and bows<br/>but when the prince isn\u2019t looking, <br/>the faintest sneer plays over her lips<br/><br/>If they\u2019re on the same wavelength they might have generated a lot of dramatic questions.<br/>That poor concubine, what\u2019s she going to do?<br/>What\u2019s the traveler after in the city?<br/><br/>Continue play will answer these questions and generate more. This is the play to find out stuff and a method of finding out.<br/><br/>Now why not just use this method instead of any other? The inertia of tradition? Yeah for the most part. I\u2019d have a better time using the above system than say Fiasco. Is it better than Burning Wheel though?<br/><br/>Let\u2019s put Burning Wheel aside for a moment and get more fundamental. Let\u2019s ask what the player/GM division brings to the above and if we we\u2019re getting really technical, along what lines we\u2019re splitting stuff up. (Can the player make up plates, cities, callous princes?)<br/><br/>For me the rough division allows me to inhabit a character and make choices as a character, and have hopes for the character, and that\u2019s special in a way that just narrating stuff isn\u2019t. Why only play one? Well the biggest reason is because what do I do if two characters I own interact?<br/><br/>So that\u2019s a case for \u2018only play one character\u2019 and \u2018gm/player\u2019 division of stuff. My previous story might also be a case for \u2018sometimes use the dice\u2019.<br/><br/>Do we agree that the above mechanics do get us emergence? They generate questions which we wants answers to and some of those questions will be decided by the player \u2018what does he do?\u2019 some will be decided by the dice in response to what a player does  \u2018what effect does his course of action have?\u2019 and some will be decided by the GM because of what NPC\u2019s do and what elements are brought into the sis in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485020/#Comment_485020" name="Item_357" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T08:07:38+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  8:07AM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite" rel="nofollow">AlexanderWhite</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Let\u2019s say we\u2019re playing Feng Shui and our characters are in a kitchen fighting bad guys.

I saw myself as a story teller, movie director. It was almost all improvised but I was the one spinning the yarn, wanting to surprise &amp; entertain &amp; impress them. I'd sometimes go like "OK, and now we enter your apartment... let's hear what you have in there" and have them describe their own apartment and be amused by that. That does not qualify. So I get why peeps might be "oh, she didn't play 90s style the right way", I'll add: <i>Buuut...</i><br/><br/><b>Later when I was looking for "rules"</b> just prior to mirror story<br/>Yes, my goal at this point was to reach some sorta meaningful "play to find out".

But we have some commentators saying they don\u2019t even believe vegetable soup or fruit punch can even exist.</p><p>Shimrod, you brought up the traditional technique of information separation. Of havign a GM role while the players are having their characters make actions in the game world.</p><p>But when there\u2019s quantum raiders/traders in the west, or a quantum duchess/butler/priest holding that garrotte\u2026 isn\u2019t it utterly meaningless. I played this way for many years. And I just can\u2019t.</p><p>Obv the challenge element of trying to guess what number you\u2019re thinking of breaks down if you\u2019re not <em>really</em> thinking of a number, you\u2019ll just say \u201cno\u201d until we\u2019ve said 99 random numbers and then say yes on whatever number is the very last one.</p><p>But it\u2019s not just the challenge element. It\u2019s also the discovery element. \u201cExploration\u201d in the three pillars sense, not the GNS sense. We open the lid and what do we find? Turns out there\u2019s nothing there. Because you are just making things up.</p><p>It\u2019s also the story or drama element. Our characters want to make meaningful consequences but we can\u2019t do that because everywhere we turn there\u2019s just smoke and mirrors. We are ghosts, we are shadows.</p><p>Sure, we can turn to each other, collide with each other, which I\u2019ve acknowledged above. At least we know that our <em>selves</em> are solid. A drama game just needs the four walls and each other\u2019s faces to stare coldly into. Full Blorb in 5 seconds of prep \u201cwall wall wall wall table chair chair go\u201d. Awesome games have been had.</p><p>But that\u2019s not what you\u2019re talking about with your [raider|trader] west and your [duchess|butler|priest] murderer. You\u2019re asking us to get hyped up about discovering / exploring / not knowing / finding out something when there <em>is</em> nothing to discover, explore, wonder about, or find out.</p><p>\u201cBut Sandra\u201d, everyone says, \u201cthere are awesome <em>stories</em> to be told about someone travelling west or someone investigating a murderer and we can tell those stories with much less work by just improvising it all! <strong>And</strong> those stories will me much better and tighter than flailing around in the blorb!\u201d. <strong>YES.</strong> But the traditional techniques both set up the wrong expectations, and they are a waste, they get in the way of taking advantage of all the creativity you have around that table. Play Lovecraftesque, play Nerver av st\xe5l, play any of a bunch of games that work with this goal.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485038/#Comment_485038" name="Item_372" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T15:00:25+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  3:00PM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It isn't just a matter of being a lot less work.<br/><br/>It's also a matter of GM burnout. <br/><br/>Fully Blorby ( I hate that word, a lot) play requires an enormous commitment of time and energy for the GM, even if they are only using pre-made material and appropriate random charts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485041/#Comment_485041" name="Item_373" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T15:10:55+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  3:10PM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob" rel="nofollow">komradebob</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I hate that word, a lot</p></div></blockquote>\nI think I should take another break from S-G.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob" rel="nofollow">komradebob</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>It isn't just a matter of being a lot less work.<br/><br/>It's also a matter of GM burnout. <br/><br/>Fully Blorby ( I hate that word, a lot) play requires an enormous commitment of time and energy for the GM, even if they are only using pre-made material and appropriate random charts.</p></div></blockquote>\nI want to teach it and make it easier.

I don't think Trad techniques are necessarily good when you're trying to do something far different.<br/><br/>As far as Blorb itself, have you asked yourself in a serious way how far you are willing to go for that and why?<br/><br/>To me, a lot of this seems like a mental exercise somewhat removed from the implications of it's deployment in practice.<br/><br/>For example, I could see someone willing to commit to designing for and GMing bloboriffic play for one relatively self-contained "adventure" ( however may sessions, but a relatively small number).<br/><br/>I could see a sequel, or two, with significant time in between playing them ( it takes time to create that level of blorbiness, even employing random charts appropriate to the setting).<br/><br/>What I have a hard time imagining is a single GM committing to doing this long-term with real fidelity and neutrality with a consistent group of players.<br/><br/><br/>You've said you want to play a character in this style of game. Would you consistently, perhaps for years, commit to doing it as GM for other people? Could you foresee doing it without slipping into some of the bad ( not-very-blorby) habits you're against?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485044/#Comment_485044" name="Item_375" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T15:43:24+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  3:43PM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as we know, Sandra does, indeed, do just that on a regular basis (sometimes more than one session a week!).

I don't want a "funnel" type structure, I want them to be able to go pretty much anywhere. The Lost Mines of Phandelver was good, as was B4 The Lost City, and Curse of Strahd. The castle is right there on the hill, or you can go explore the country side and there is <i>plenty</i> there. I placed the Deep Carbon Observatory and Carrowmore in Barovia.<br/><br/>We've been doing a jungle hex crawl (with a couple of dungeon here and there on that hexmap) for the last year and change, and are in a big dungeon now.<br/><br/>I had an idea a while back that I haven't really tried out yet that would be sort of a compromise between creating the entire country in advance, which is what I would've <i>wanted</i> to do a la <a href="https://batintheattic.blogspot.com/2009/08/how-to-make-fantasy-sandbox.html" rel="nofollow">this overly ambituous setup</a>, but I've never been able to actually do that, between that overly ambitious methond vs the "create each hex randomly as we go along" method which I think is not solid enough.<br/><br/>That compromise is the <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/the_quest_queue/" rel="nofollow">quest queue</a>. That blog post is just a sketch, it needs some more codifying (exact distances per tier primarily). That way I could create new modules (using random generators online, using my own homebrew stuff, using finished modules from other people [both from WotC and from third party]) without quantuming them them or forcing them, just placing them on the quest queue. I haven't really tried it because a lot of the time I use modules where there is a lot of stuff already. A big region + a buncha dungeons.<br/><br/>I used the big region map from the railroaded adventure "Corsairs of the Great Sea" and let them loose using it as a sandbox, I had placed a buncha the Yawning Portal dungeons nearby too, but they also did explore one of the sites from that railroaded adventure. I let the factions and agendas from the railroaded adventure be true, I just threw out the timeline; just used the starting situation.<br/><br/>I experimented with "an island rises from the bottom of the sea" to change it from scripted ("when the characters reach this or that level") to be a daily die roll. "Did the island rise today" But that experiment, well, the campaign ended before that happened.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485050/#Comment_485050" name="Item_381" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T16:25:08+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  4:25PM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just get the starter set and run it blorbily and then build from there.\u2665<br/>That's what I did.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485052/#Comment_485052" name="Item_382" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T16:37:00+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  4:37PM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2019 4:37PM by Paul_T.">edited June 3</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oddly enough, I think the \u201cendless prep\u201d problem, while real, is kind of a red herring in this thread.<br/><br/>However - and this is the odd part! - once we understand how to determine \u201csaliency\u201d this whole problem goes away and we can have any mixture of blorb and non-blorb that we want.

There are two different old TSR RPGs from the '80s that I'd like very much to run like you're suggesting.

Each time, it led me to improvise on the spot, something that would seem to fly directly in the face of world consistency and pre-existence.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485056/#Comment_485056" name="Item_384" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T17:12:26+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  5:12PM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob" rel="nofollow">komradebob</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>What do you do to confine play within an area to allow better blorbiness?

There are some things that are nailed down, even if they remain off-screen for the time being. Typically, for example, stats of major NPCs, locations of major cities or dungeons, maybe the stats for a certain magic item. Parts of the backstory / secret history of the world. (There's even a special reward in BW for getting invested in the GM's hard-prepped stuff, the Deeds point.)<br/><br/>The thing you're missing about BW is because of your failure to consider the possibility of a fourth way.<br/><br/>-It isn't aiming for 90's style trad illusionist bullshit.<br/><br/>-It isn't aiming for "pure" story-game, where we are all 100% collaborating together to build the world and the events.<br/><br/>-It isn't aiming for blorb.<br/><br/>The thing BW is aiming for necessitates some mix of hard-prepped and improvised setting elements. I think maybe "Dramatic Protagonism" or something is a good name for it.<br/><br/>Think of it this way: to a vegetarian, you shouldn't put even a small amount of grilled hamburger meat in the meal. But to a non-vegetarian, it's perfectly fine to mix meat and vegetables to achieve whatever it is you *are* aiming for in that meal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485060/#Comment_485060" name="Item_387" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T17:30:26+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  5:30PM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob" rel="nofollow">komradebob</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>What do you do to confine play within an area to allow better blorbiness?

For our Curse of Strahd campaign I had decided that the campaign would end when Strahd died. (It took a bunch of PC parties dying before that happened.) I pitched it to the players as less of a funnel, and more of a\u2026 there are a hundred loaded rat traps in this dark room. One of them is red.

Assume the GM has created a small keep as an encounter, complete with some memorable NPCs and a few adventure hooks. If the GM has already told the players the keep is along the left road, or given them a map showing the keep on the left road, then in the game world that\u2019s where the keep is. If they choose to travel the road on the right, there is no logically consistent way they will arrive at the keep.<br/>However, if the keep was not previously mentioned, the GM can place it along whichever road the party chooses to travel \u2013 if they go left, it\u2019s along the left road; if they go right, it\u2019s along the right road \u2013 and as far as the game world (and the players) are concerned, that\u2019s where it has always been. Similarly, the keep the GM created doesn\u2019t have to be a keep. If the party knows the keep is along the left road, and they choose to travel the right road, perhaps they eventually come upon a cross- roads inn, where many of the same NPCs and adventure hooks from the keep now reside.<br/>To some, this may seem somehow sneaky or underhanded. However, enjoying an RPG is about the willing suspension of disbelief \u2013 players want to lose themselves in an imaginary world for a time, pretending to be a fictional character. As long as the wires behind the scenes, holding the sets together, don\u2019t intrude into the game, most players don\u2019t care much about how they get to the fun. They just care about getting there.</p></blockquote><p>To which I say\u2026 <strong>why is there even a fork in the road then?</strong></p><p>Even sandbox hero Kevin Crawford has \u201cyou should have a bunch of prepared sites in your folder to pull out\u201d and I\u2019m like, uh, I\u2019m not so sure that\u2019s legit.</p><p>I always want to move all content \u201cthrough the gloracle\u201d somehow.</p><p>I\u2019d rather put the keep on the random encounter table than to \u201cforce\u201d the players to visit it using those tricks.</p><p>In my game though, almost all sites are fixed to the map rather than reside on the encounter table. I\u2019d rather try something like the \u201c<a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/the_quest_queue/" rel="nofollow">The Quest Queue</a>\u201d if I wanted to place content randomly because of the idea put forth there: information=agency.</p><p>That said, I normally just use a map that have locations hard placed already. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s hard to have a bunch of dungeons placed around a town\u2026? I don\u2019t have to be super familiar with the dungeons before the players go there. Just skim through them.</p><h2 id="when-is-it-legitimate-to-reuse-unexplored-content">When is it legitimate to reuse unexplored content?</h2><p>If it\u2019s a new campaign. If the players didn\u2019t even <em>hear</em> of the site, it\u2019s fine to just copy it over to a new location on the new campaign. If they heard about it but rejected it (maybe because they didn\u2019t have time to go there, or because they didn\u2019t want to go there, or they tried going there but didn\u2019t like being there), then I ask them. That was the case in our first aQ campaign, I had placed B4 The Lost City and The Caverns of Thracia near the city of Mahabba and also generated a bunch of city stuff in there and smaller dungeons in the city, some homebrew, some stuff out of Red Tide and from a random city book. The players briefly visited the Caverns of Thracia (and lost a couple of PCs there) but decided to concentrate on the Lost City which to them was more interesting [because it was a more newly opened up area diegetically, I had decided that \u201ca pyramid had been uncovered in a sandstorm\u201d whether the Caverns of Thracia was more \u201cmeh it\u2019s been there for a while\u201d in their estimation] and also they had just had a bunch of deaths in the Caverns of Thracia.</p><p>So when I later wanted to place the Caverns of Thracia in another campaign, I asked them (ooc) for permission to do so. [In the end that campaign hasn\u2019t started yet.]</p><p>If you\u2019re still in the same campaign, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s legit. The players might still go there later. They might still go back to that left fork and go see that keep, in the GURPS example.</p><p>The \u201cTomb of Annihilation\u201d module is a hexmap that\u2019s kinda sparsely populated. It says \u201cFeel free to move areas around so that they get in your players path\u201d and I was like \u201cnuh-uh, that\u2019s against our table\u2019s social contract\u201d and stuck with their listed locations. (With one example: I decided (for myself, this wasn\u2019t something I ran by the players) that IF the characters got dragged off to a goblin village, I\u2019d use the \u201cgoblin village\u201d location and move it, letting it stand in for \u201ca generic goblin village\u201d and change the name. Them getting dragged off to a goblin village, or even them stalking some goblins home to their village, felt kinda unlikely to happen and they were more likely to stumble over the real location of that particular village.

How does that sound?<br/><br/>Ok:<br/><br/>The basis of this thread is the idea that doing Narrativism (for the sake of this thread, I think this can be treated as "rpg play with an interest in an exciting story we all get invested in, as its main priority") with traditional techniques (which may or may not include blorb; not sure on that one) is a bad idea.<br/><br/>Is that a fair summation of your thesis here?<br/><br/>Now, given that, here are the arguments I think you've made in this thread:<br/><br/>1. Using traditional techniques sends the wrong expectations to the players, who may assume that "blorby" methods are being used in the game.<br/><br/>Breaking that expectation can harm the game and/or people's enjoyment of it.<br/><br/>2. Therefore, if you're playing a Narrativist game, you should make it crystal clear that it's not "blorby", and, furthermore, you should do that by avoiding traditional techniques.<br/><br/>3. You've outlined five "pillars" of traditional, blorby play, and you feel that they go well together, support each other, and create a whole that's coherent and strong and solid.<br/><br/>Is that a fair summary?

introduces challenges to player beliefs (through events and NPCs): end of session rewards.<br/><br/>In Torchbearer, if a player didn't have an opportunity to act on a belief, then they should consider rewriting it.

Have good random tables or develop them in play. It would be more challenging, but I do believe there is a fair amount of pre-written scifi content already available. If you go for more fantastic scifi, then there is Star wars and Starfinder (scifi Pathfinder); with harder scifi, there might be stuff for Traveller and probably some Star frontiers things would also work. Then there are all possible movies and computer games - Starcraft campaign scenarios would give fine pieces of overland maps, for example. Some locations/space ships in Alien movies could be used.\n<blockquote><br/>How do you avoid playing into your players' interests in the name of a consistent world?<br/></blockquote>\nBy using random tables, thinking how likely things would be and rolling dice, and by having a varied set of players.\n<blockquote><br/>And, while I can see a single person committing to it as designer/GM, I just don't see how that works out well in the long-term for that person, nor do I see how it encourages anyone else to take up that same level of commitment.<br/></blockquote>\nI have been running a sandbox world for several years now; sometimes with different rules systems, sometimes at cons. I have moved twice, and occasionally still run a game for the people in the city and country where I started the campaign/world.<br/><br/>Many parts of the game world are quite familiar and have layers of history.\n<blockquote><br/> What do you do to confine play within an area to allow better blorbiness?

Another is to plop a suitable map/adventure to fill the empty place, if you know of any; and if you know of several that would be good fits, roll a die.<br/>Here, "suitable" means that it fits with what has already been established in the fiction.<br/><br/>The setting would have to be quite small and isolated to really become empty - someone will grab power, creatures will move in from elsewhere if there is unclaimed space, etc. There are neighbouring regions.<br/><br/>Of course, any given group of player characters might settle in and retire, which establishes yet another set of non-player characters that will shape the world further and can be interacted with by new characters.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>For me, the important thing is to consider the game world as a larger thing, and the given set of player characters as an incidental disruptive force that changes things and acts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485168/#Comment_485168" name="Item_422" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-04T07:44:30+00:00" title="June  4, 2019  7:44AM">June 4</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2019 9:11AM by 2097.">edited June 4</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Hello,<br/><br/>I just had an epiphany while reading <a href="/forums/profile/moconnor%27s">@moconnor's</a> description of Klockwerk in the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22118/half-myth-why-burning-wheel-is-a-no-myth-game" rel="nofollow">"Half-myth" (why Burning Wheel is a no myth game)</a> thread.<br/><br/>This is no way meant to disparage or in any way cast shadows on Sandra's game style but I think what she's attempting to create is the <i>anti-Turing Machine</i> experience.

I just had a nice idea that a certain assassin the player characters hurt might send a message back, probably with a poison. It would fit their nature. But then: Would they have access to such a poison? No, their equipment has been defined. Could they manufacture some kind of poison? Possibly. so I set up probabilities and roll a die.<br/><br/>The idea that they might use poison was one of these spontaneous ideas. They could just as well slipped away silently, for example, never to be heard from again. That is what another bad guy is planning to do, for example. I do not start second-guessing each such decision.\n<blockquote><br/>2) This next part is possibly a bad derail, but I'm trying to figure out how I'd make 2097's on-steroids version of pre-game prep work with either Boot Hill or Gangbusters, two of my old-timey favorite TSR games.

Use something like reaction rolls to determine who are friendly and who not. Turn scripted events into random ones; roll when the invaders land and start their attack, either by making it an encounter table entry or adding a separate larger scale event table, or just saying it happens in d20 months.<br/><br/>If the adventure has all the events focused on the scripted path the players take, you might want to add more content to other places on the map, too.<br/><br/>You are grabbing locations, monsters, NPC:s, and the setting from the adventure, not the plot. For some adventures it might not be worth it to do this; you would gain too little and throw away too much. In that case, find a better adventure or source to mine.<br/><br/>I am not familiar with Boot hill or Gangbusters. For a western, I would imagine that many D&amp;D villages would be fine, since they always have general stores and other western colour.<br/><br/>If Gangbusters is more urban, then you might want to find as a good a map of the city as possible. Maybe get some inspiration, or at least a review of existing technology, from Alexandrian's writing on urban adventuring: <a href="https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/36473/roleplaying-games/thinking-about-urbancrawls" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/36473/roleplaying-games/thinking-about-urbancrawls</a> (a long series)<br/><br/>Non-player characters with lists of goals, personality and resources at hand might be the most useful kind of prep, there. The "resources at hand" is often missing from or mostly handwaved in character drama games, but if the game has a challenge dimension, then it is vital.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485221/#Comment_485221" name="Item_429" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-04T15:03:14+00:00" title="June  4, 2019  3:03PM">June 4</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my actual practice that's how I'd run the poison guy too.

(This time I <i>think</i> I am using the term correctly...I hope).  Your algorithms are your hard resolution mechanics and pre-generated tables of random encounters.  From there the machine idles until the players do something that the machine is programmed to recognize or a random encounter is triggered.<br/><br/>To prove to the players that you are indeed not exercising Agency you have the Social Contract stipulations about your notes being available.  You also use the Hyper Clarity process so the players can indeed see that it's "truly" the algorithms that are resolving the tasks and that you are in no way involved.  Yet that's not entirely true.  The new combat system that you created with the help of posters here to create powerful and exciting combats is an expression of your creative aesthetics about how the game should be played/experienced.  Yet for all your efforts the combat system is highly stylized and does not match the real world in the least.  Nothing wrong with that at all as no combat system replicates "reality."  Huzzah for succeeding!  But this does clash with the idea of wanting to create "reality."  What you've created does not come even close to how "real" combat works and from my perspective <i>nor should it</i>.  It is designed in a way that really, really jazzes you and your players and that rawks.  But that is not reality, that's buy in.<br/><br/>I just wanted to point out that the world "real" or "reality" just doesn't apply to a exercise that is imaginary.  What you are trying to create for your players is a strong sense of plausibility via credibility.  As long as how the game rolls comports with their sense of plausibility then the sense of real in strengthened.  But there is no real.  If the players ever truly felt that what they were experiencing in game was objectively real then they would, definitionally, be dissociating from reality - hallucinating if you will.  They would stop miming their combat actions and just start hacking at your with whatever could be pressed into service as a weapon.<br/><br/>I just found this in <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=9826.msg103439#msg103439" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> and it references game prep and Fang Langford - \n<blockquote><b>Preparation</b>: By this formulation, preparation simply amounts to one player's construction of an imaginary space which he wants to make shared.  But the only way that space becomes shared is through progressive Validations, leading to Integrations; in short, the other players must Abduce the total space.  All the preparation in the world is not play, because it doesn't create Proposals; semiotically, there are no signs, because all signs require an interpretant to be such, and since there are no signs, no Abduction can occur.  One person creating a personal language in a closet is doing something, but it's not communication.<br/><br/>This reminds me of some old threads about No Myth gamemastering.  Fang Langford emphasized this 'myth' that prepared material was already present in the game, and said that on the contrary, nothing is present in the shared space until it's, well, shared.  The semiotic model would support that conclusion: you can Explore a pre-prepared space, just as you can Explore a totally open-ended one, and either way it requires addition because it requires successive Abductions and Deductions.</blockquote>\nWe run into further questions about creating a "reality" that is really real when we consider just how complex the world is.  Do you model a tree falling in a forest using material sciences equations for wood?  When characters ford a strong do you use fluid dynamics equations to model the forces of the water?  Do you take into account why the tree fell?  What is merely diseased or was it dead?  Did a beaver have a hand in it or was it Wood Boring Beetles?  Perhaps it was a long drought?  Do you model weather using nonlinear mathematics?  What about flooding?  Do you model the wildlife populations and how they all interact with each other?  No.  Of course not.  Because information of this sort just isn't salient most of the time and when it is a reasonable representation is plausible enough.  But whatever that representation is it is neither accurate or 'real', just plausible enough to stand in for our conception of "reality."<br/><br/>The point is in an RPG the very idea of a "tangible really 'real' world" is really just a construct - a castle in the air, if you will.  One that you've worked very very hard to construct.  You've also made many many aesthetic choices to are really just expressions of your personal tastes.  It's all good.  The same goes with the process of play you've created.<br/><br/>My game has been described as opaque (for understandable reasons but its really a matter of CA expectation mismatch) yet you work very very hard to keep the black curtain closed with regards to your creative input.  From what I can noodle out is that you've placed your Agency at a full step removed from actual game play.  IOW you express your agency about how the game should be run (from both a designer and an aesthetic perspective) in your game pregen and the various random tables and your growing and evolving resolution mechanics.  Which, from what I've seen, are hard core Task Resolution methods which suits your Klockwerk/blorb very well.  The idea of "fairness" matched with intense reliance on Task Resolution very strongly suggests a Challenge based game.  No changing things willy-nilly here.  If the player has a sucky outcome that the way life breaks.  If the game stalls and goes nowhere for hours in real time, tough luck.  That's the way life works.<br/><br/>However, I think lots of the problems in these threads is the lack of a common vocabulary and people arguing back and forth about this game and that game without a conceptual framework is really hurting the process.  I think I'll start a thread just for that purpose but in effort to open and honest I make to claim to the actual text.  It was written by someone much smarter than I.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485359/#Comment_485359" name="Item_435" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-05T20:35:13+00:00" title="June  5, 2019  8:35PM">June 5</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2019 8:37PM by DeReel.">edited June 5</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No no.

I think that's valid and a real thing to talk about.<br/><br/>However, I feel - and have felt all along - that <i>pretending something which isn't real is tangible</i> is a vital part of roleplaying, and a big part of what makes "klockwerk" tick. Yes.<br/><br/>But... claiming that a game with a prepped dungeon is somehow fundamentally "more real" than one without is self-delusion, in my opinion. <br/><br/>To lose sight of the fact that we're all sitting around at a table making stuff up seems... completely dishonest, in my opinion.<br/><br/>When you tell your friend to get some "angel wings and heaven pie", of course she can't do that, because she's in an actual, physical store and there is no "heaven pie" there. In an RPG, you can always say that, yes, there is heaven pie, and from now the game state has changed: to ignore that we can (and do!) constantly "change the contents of the store" is a huge oversight.<br/><br/>If that wasn't the case, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/485271/#Comment_485271" rel="nofollow">errors and misunderstandings</a> couldn't happen. That would be impossible!<br/><br/>Sure, at Sandra's table we all buy into a collective delusion that there is something real we're interacting with, and she does her best to maintain that through her prep, principles, and resolution techniques, but it's still a - constructive and fun, sure! but a - delusion.<br/><br/>It's easy to prove, because if anyone ever screws up and misreports something, that supposedly "real thing" is instantly transformed. In the real grocery store, there's no chance of coming home with some "angel wings". In this kind of game, all it takes is for the friend to say, "sure, I'll get you some angel wings" and bam! the grocery now has angel wings and (even more importantly) <i>has had angel wings all along</i>.<br/><br/>In short, I don't think any amount of discussion about how 'real' something like this might feel discredits with Silmenume and Chris Lehrich and Le Joueur are saying about the idea of "Myth". To claim otherwise is extremely dishonest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485391/#Comment_485391" name="Item_443" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-05T21:55:00+00:00" title="June  5, 2019  9:55PM">June 5</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>But\u2026 claiming that a game with a prepped dungeon is somehow fundamentally \u201cmore real\u201d than one without is self-delusion, in my opinion.</p></div></blockquote><p>To avoid this semantic-layer debate, which to me is kind of \u201cfinger pointing at moon\u201d rather than \u201cmoon\u201d level, we are tryning to use \u201coffscreen canon game-state\u201d rather than \u201creal\u201d.

It may help to understand, perhaps, that the sort of transformative "breakthrough" you experienced by discovering "blorby" play - finally finding the "good stuff" in gaming! - came for me by encountering and understanding the Lumpley Principle. After all, I <i>had started out the whole business of gaming</i> from the basis of "blorb" or "klockwerk" and a "real game-state", and had a pretty miserable time. So the idea that sticking to "klockwerk" techniques will improve and fix gaming is a hard one for me to take seriously, since that's where I started in the first place.)<br/><br/>(More theoretically, I'm not sure how you can even maintain a coherent real-world understanding of what happens at the game table without the Lumpley Principle - it's like the concept of evolution by natural selection when it comes to biology, or gravity or the Three Laws of Motion for Newtonian physics, etc; it's pretty fundamental.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485410/#Comment_485410" name="Item_453" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-05T23:14:03+00:00" title="June  5, 2019 11:14PM">June 5</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2019 11:14PM by Jeph.">edited June 5</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you really just need a very small revision to the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Lumpley</span> Baker-Care-Boss Principle:<br/><br/>From: "System (including but not limited to 'the rules') is defined as the means by which the group agrees to imagined events during play."<br/><br/>To: "System (including but not limited to 'the rules') is defined as the means by which the group agrees to imagined events <b>and gamestate changes</b> during play."<br/><br/>Just, recognizing that there are things that matter outside the imagined events.

I do <i>not</i> suggest that we use this term, since its two meanings already cause a lot of confusion in other circles, but it does bring to light another distinction that needs made:<br/><br/>In <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> 's example there is a clear difference between (A) the prepped/placed sword and (B) the fact that according to the wandering monster table, even before the GM has rolled the dice, the dragon might exist.  Both of these things are "virtual" in Deleuze's sense, but just before the PCs enter the room the sword is only virtual <i>to them</i> (to the GM it is already in the "gamestate"), while in example B the dragon is virtual to everyone at the table.  This difference is not just a matter of a flipped bit: these two types of objects have completely different lines of ingress and means of state change.<br/><br/>So yeah, the various levels of ontology and virtuality present in a game will need words if they are to be discussed, but low-res/abstract terms like "real" will not be up to the task, and this is exactly why philosophers are always inventing their own nuanced words and use cases for them.  I'm fine with "gamestate" but I don't think it will carry us the whole way.<br/><br/>At a certain point we will need to begin speaking of "orders" or "levels" of nested or hierarchically-relative ontologies, and of virtualities (in the sense of potential events) relative to different players, functional roles ("GM," "Player," even "Player with a Drama Token," etc), as well as to playstyles, rulesets, situations, and maybe even genres.  These are all assemblages of different types.  Some are encapsulated within others, and even this encapsulation differs depending on game rules and playstyle.<br/><br/>It would be a huge mistake to think that a single ontological model could encompass all possible states of all possible objects and potentialities in all possible rulesets that all humans might consider an "RPG" without sacrificing the majority of useful detail to abstraction, leaving us back in the "cloud."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485424/#Comment_485424" name="Item_461" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-06T04:03:17+00:00" title="June  6, 2019  4:03AM">June 6</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The more I consider it, the more I think the idea of gamestate is completely compatible with Vincent and Emily's Principle as originally stated, no modification necessary.<br/><br/>Gamestate is, after all, simply a highly regimented way by which the group agrees to imagined events.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485425/#Comment_485425" name="Item_462" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-06T04:44:28+00:00" title="June  6, 2019  4:44AM">June 6</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Paul, re your uneasiness because of your previous bad experiences with this concept, I think you\u2019re right that there are some other missing pieces.

In our model, unshared facts can be canon.</p><p>In our model, Kanadius [an NPC from B4 The Lost City] is an entity that can be part of the diegesis even without anyone in our own group knowing that he exists. (Just like The Show is part of the diegesis for the Moneyball movie even while the DVD is still in it\u2019s shrink wrapper and we haven\u2019t seen it yet.)</p><p>Because during prep sometimes you go \u201cOK, this module goes here, this one goes here\u201d and maybe you don\u2019t read them that carefully because you\u2019re not sure the PCs are gonna go there. In a semiotic analysis of our model, that exact moment is when the referent is constructed, when you say \u201cOK the Lost City goes in this hex\u201d. I\u2019ll drop the semiotics talk btw, sorry for nerding it up yesterday; it was sort of a direct reply to\u2026 uh\u2026 some posts from 15 years ago\u2665</p><p>The fact that Kanadius is the Grand Master of the Brotherhood of Gorm, that fact is also an entity that\u2019s part of the diegesis in the same manner.</p><p>In our model, the rules do cover injecting entities into the diegesis even when that action isn\u2019t \u201cshared\u201d.</p><p>Now, for my own game, that \u201crule\u201d isn\u2019t particularly systemic, the rule is I can do pretty much whatever I want in terms of <em>adding</em> tier 1 and tier 2 \u2018truth\u2019 entities between sessions (and that it\u2019s better to do it between campaigns than between sessions but that\u2019s also a very difficult limitation creating a lot of upfront work. Which <a href="/forums/profile/Jon">@Jon</a> and friend managed to pull off otoh. One day\u2026) whereas <em>changing</em> things would be more controversal. The tier 3 layer is a last-resort safety-net. \u201cOops I guess that chest was empty [note to self, make rules to disclaim decision-making for chest contents].\u201d (Btw, this is kind of a side observation but the tier three fallback <em>sometimes also creates new rules</em>; \u201cI don\u2019t know how much magically active moss you can find in a day in the forest, let me make some rules for finding that out.\u201d)</p><p>When I first started wrestling with this new model, from OSR games, I was like \u201cOooh, the dungeon-generation and the dungeon-stocking algorithms are key\u201d. I wanted to solve <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22113/when-i-was-lost-and-cried-out-for-blorb-and-couldnt-find-blorb/p1" rel="nofollow">the chasm width problem</a>.</p><p>No, while they are really good tools for producing a well made porte-monstre-tr\xe9sor array, following them strictly isn\u2019t necessary; it turns out \u201cNo Paper before seeing Rock\u201d is enough to solve the chasm width problem. The rules for <em>what</em> you introduce can be kinda generous/sloppy towards the DM, as long as you\u2019re careful about <em>when</em> you introduce things. Those algorithms are useful because you want a good match of goals to problems (\u201cgold\u201d to \u201cmonsters\u201d), and they can help you find that sorta self-balancingness that D&amp;D can have when the players can sorta decide on their own which areas they are ready for and which areas they are not strong enough for yet. But while \u201cNo Paper before seeing Rock\u201d is an appropriate rule for OSR-style prep; it\u2019s not sufficient for something like an on-model take on <abbr title="Burning Wheel">BW</abbr>-like game where you\u2019d want to have a rule or system that injects entities into the diegesis that are especially appropriate for the protagonized <abbr title="Beliefs in the BW-specific sense, that is">Beliefs</abbr>.</p><p>What we do in actual practice in our D&amp;D game [so not sure how prescriptive this particular example should be] is that we can inject entities into the diegesis when we are in character creation mode. \u201cOh, you rolled up that you had a rival from theatre school? I\u2019ll place her in town X and also on encounter tables Y and Z.\u201d Now, yes, I <em>had</em> seen Rock while choosing that Paper. So apparently the \u201cNo Paper before seeing Rock\u201d principle isn\u2019t the be-all, end-all solution and we need to find a better rule to replace it.

It's absolutely key to blorby/klockwerk play - the whole concept of disciplined prep. (And it's also freeing to realize that this means you can make all kinds of stuff up on the spot, so long as it precedes the players' choice - the proverbial "Rock". Maintaining that hygiene is much easier if you do it well in advance, but it's not impossible - for instance, not knowing what the players are thinking of doing is often sufficient for a "on the spot" invention to be entirely hygienic.)\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>\u201cOh, you rolled up that you had a rival from theatre school?

Making those choices - what will I do with that rival from theatre school so as to make life interesting for the PC? - is at the heart of play.<br/><br/>There are all the same issues of saliency and Paper-before-Rock, but they occur in very different places and in very different ways. (Now, our hygiene is all about taking our hands off the PCs' choices and the resolution of in-game conflicts, instead of porte-monstre-tresor.*)<br/><br/><br/>*: If you look at AW's rules, you'll find all kinds of ways that they force the MC(GM) to take their hands off these decision points, from the way you can't change the "difficulty" of making moves to "all NPCs have the same number of hit points" to "under these conditions, this move gets triggered" to "this is how hunger works in the hardhold" to "say what honesty demands/what your prep demands" and so on and so on. It's much more subtle than in earlier Narrativist designs, but it's enough to have a strong effect on gameplay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485429/#Comment_485429" name="Item_465" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-06T04:57:08+00:00" title="June  6, 2019  4:57AM">June 6</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2019 4:57AM by Paul_T.">edited June 6</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph" rel="nofollow">Jeph</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Are you also asking whether the presence of the encounter table in the prep implies that there's a green dragon in the gamestate, before we ever roll?<br/><br/>Depends on the rules.<br/><br/>In other words, depends on whether this group has agreed that every entity on an encounter table is in the gamestate but not yet in the imagined events...<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nI was hoping my italicized text at the bottom of my post would be enough to address this, but apparently it wasn't.

(And, for that matter, <a href="https://www.panix.com/~sos/rpg/slug.html" rel="nofollow">SLUG</a> a decade earlier.)</p><p>The \u201cno-myth\u201d model is a rule that says \u201centities can only be injected into the diegesis by being shared\u201d.</p><p><em>[For example, the predicate entity \u201cThe party, except the rogue, are currently in room 12\u201d is injected into the diegesis by the playes saying \u201cWe go through the door.

For instance, trust may be built by a campaign accruing TPKs, easy wins, anticlimaxes etc. A multi-pronged approach (transparency, accumulating trust, hygienic principles etc.) is probably best.<br/><br/>In narrativist play, we want to make interesting choices and <b>thereby judge the fiction ourselves</b> (i.e., address premise). In many narrativist designs, it is largely irrelevant* how the situations offering these choices come about (similar to how in my above-mentioned 4e campaign the players did not care much how the PCs got involved in the GM's next set-piece combat -- the GM had to be a neutral referee only once we rolled for initiative).<br/><br/>*Not irrelevant, really. I'm trying to express that the GM/player setting up a situation has a lot of leeway improvising it specifically to bring about those sought-after hard choices, tailoring them to the PCs and their recent decisions, current state etc..                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485450/#Comment_485450" name="Item_481" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-06T09:12:45+00:00" title="June  6, 2019  9:12AM">June 6</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Johann" rel="nofollow">Johann</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>trust in the GM</p></div></blockquote>\nTrust but verify.

It does not describe all there is in a game though, far from it. It doesn't take into account body language at the table, for instance.

For that group, entries on encounter tables are clearly not yet diegetic.<br/><br/>But a lot of the time, you'll see an encounter table like this (from a game I'm prepping):\n<blockquote class="Quote">\n<ol>\n<li><b>Mother Hen:</b> A giant, talking, flying chicken with extremely soft, downy feathers. She is always willing to provide safety and fly someone home, if they are lost or in distress\u2014unless she is sitting an egg (25% chance). She lays giant eggs that hatch normal-sized chickens, albeit incredibly clever ones. Eating the golden yolks cures poisons and diseases, removes afflictions and curses, and can even revive the recently deceased. As a Roc with mental abilities of 16. She gives her reddish speckled feathers to her friends; they are Common one-use items that can be used to call her. She'll come along quick as she can, if not sitting an egg, arriving in (d4) minutes, tens of minutes, hours, or days. The feathers don't work for anyone but the one she gives them to.</li>\n<li><b>Les Trois Sourisquetaires:</b> The mice, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, who are considered by many (and certainly by themselves) to be the greatest adventurers of the age. They are just talking mice; no particular combat ability, but they always want to prove themselves the cleverest and bravest. They are quick to take insult, issue challenge, and strike up a rivalry, and profuse with stories of their own exploits. Each 1HD.</li>\n<li><b>Collector:</b> A forty-foot-tall brass and ceramic stick-man who strides across the world on stilt-legs, plucking up things and placing them in the bird-cages that dangle from his body. He is intelligent, and many things interest him; he will often stop to listen or contemplate. But he never responds; merely swats things away and strides off if annoyed. Swarms of easily-angered wasps live in several of his cages. (As an Iron Golem with d4+1 insect swarms. Instead of poison breath, when he hits with a Slam, may forego dealing damage to snatch a Medium or smaller creature up and place it in a cage. Base speed is 60 feet. Disengage as bonus action. Int 14. Gargantuan size.)</li>\n<li><b>Red dragons</b>, out hunting; lair located in the nearest mountains, possibly quite distant. Equal chance of Wyrmling, Young, Adult, or Ancient. Wyrmlings will be a clutch of 1d4; young adults and ancient are solitary; adults have a 50% chance of being in a mated pair. If followed back to its mountain lair, a wyrmling's hoard is worth 1d6 x 100 GP; each age category is x10. Plus 50% chance of a magic item: uncommon for wyrmling, rare for young adult, very rare for adult, and legendary for ancient.</li>\n<li>...</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\nHere, it's clearly a mix.<br/><br/>The existence of Mother Hen, the Mouseketeers, and Collector as individuals are part of the game state and diegetic, but not yet shared.<br/><br/>The red dragons are more complicated. The potential for red dragons is in the rules (we've agreed on this procedure that can result in red dragons appearing in the game state and imagined events). I'd probably say it's also in the game state: the potential, that is, not the dragons themselves. Are rules-in-the-textual-sense (as opposed to Baker-Care-Boss Principle rules) that we've agreed to use per the B-C-B Principle part of the game state, idunno?<br/><br/>I'm unclear about whether or not the potential for red dragons is in the diegesis. I think yes: per this particular game's convention, a generic entry on an encounter table means that at least one entity of that type exists.<br/><br/>It's very much not yet shared, that's sure. The game hasn't even started. Only one of the future players knows it even exists.

For the diegesis to exist the text has to be read by a human being.<br/><br/>What I'm picking up so far, but to my very poor memory, has not been made explicit is that what is being described as canon is being used in two different ways WRT to RPGs.<br/><br/>1.  You have the preparations made by the GM which are claimed to canon.  The information contained within said canon is not available to the players at this state.  I'm just avering that it is only the GM who has knowledge of the contents of the canon.<br/><br/>2.  You have the canon of the SIS.  This is the record of what <i>actually happened</i> as a result of play.  This canon is shared and known by all the players including the GM.  This can only happen via a communication process amongst the players, which includes the GM whereby all the players agree via consensus that of all the events proposed only those agreed upon actually have credibility.  The Lumpley (BCB) Principle in action.<br/><br/>The sticking point of calling type 1 canon is that no one but the GM knows about it.  I'm getting the sense that the end run around that issue is that via Social Contract Agreement the players can <i>read</i> the canon (the text) post hoc, e.g. after the act of Exploration (in theory terms) has come to a conclusion because it never ran through the Lumpley Principle.<br/><br/>One way to address this, which is nothing new to theory, is consider that each player has their own imaginary space while the table has the Shared Imaginary Space.  Even with this formulation one has problem that the when the Game State has yet to have any presence upon the Fact Space (the SIS).<br/><br/>Let's go back to the chess game analogy.  The chess board represents the SIS.  The pieces the various PC's and monsters.  The rules of play represent the System/resolution mechanics.  They not only inform what each piece can do, what moves are illegal and how to resolve combat.  So this chessboard with the pieces and where they currently are situation represent the current state of the SIS through time.  The referee/judge would be the Lumpley (BCB) Principle.  Victory or loss (this standing in for the abstracts that are so important in roleplay) is only informed by the pieces and how they are arranged on the board.<br/><br/>But lo!  There is much more going on in the head of the chess players than in represented on the chessboard.  What the chessboard is utterly agnostic about is the significance of the positioning of the pieces.  Nor does the chessboard concern itself with the intentions of the players i.e., what they are planning on doing next.  The only thing the chessboard is about is where the pieces are right now.  It's the players that glean meaning and significance from what on the board.  Yet the players aren't solely concerned about what's on the board.  One might be concerned that their position is untenable and fight to a quick draw to conserve mental stamina for the next match.  Maybe the winning player knows that the losing player has a real problem with noise so chomps and snaps gum.<br/><br/>But more the point about game-state the losing player may have studied every game the winning player has played and know his weaknesses.  The losing player know this information well enough to bring it into play and defeat the winning player.  But unless the losing player puts his knowledge and plan into action it does not matter to the game-state.  That knowledge of how to win this match was not put into action and thus had no effect on the game-state.<br/><br/>IOW what was privately know but not publicly shared via the chessboard (the SIS) had no effect on the game-state abstraction of win or lose in the players', referees' or spectators' minds.<br/><br/>I understand that this but an analogy with all the shortcomings inherent therein.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485531/#Comment_485531" name="Item_500" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-07T04:46:26+00:00" title="June  7, 2019  4:46AM">June 7</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2019 4:46AM by 2097.">edited June 7</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>And there\u2019s ALWAYS room for, \u201chey we rolled this encounter/this is what the module says now, but that makes no logical sense and breaks our sense of what\u2019s happening in the game, so we can\u2019t accept it\u201d, which is the Lumpley Principle in action.</p></div></blockquote> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph" rel="nofollow">Jeph</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Right, like, we\u2019ve just established a few minutes ago that The Red-Dragon Snuffing Orb has eliminated all red dragons everywhere ever, but I haven\u2019t had a chance to alter the encounter table, but we roll encounter #4\u2026</p></div></blockquote><p>\u2026???</p><p>You need to update the encounter table right away after using an Orb of Snuffing.

game-state, a canon, or a big old blorb. It can contain things that no-one at the table knows about. It doesn\u2019t even have to be <em>written</em> by a human being; I can go to a random dungeon generator site, have it generate a dungeon that no human has ever read, print it out with eyes closed, go to my hex map, say this new random dungeon is in THIS hex. It now exists and everything in it is part of the, uh, diegesis, game-state, canon, blorb\u2026 <strong>even though no human on Earth has read it, said it, or shared it</strong>.<br/><br/>This \u201cThing\u201d is a set of entities.<br/><br/>It\u2019s that set of entities that we operate on while playing and running blorb games.<br/><br/>That is our relevant data structure.<br/><br/>A subset of that set is the set of entities that have been shared.<br/><br/>Keeping track of that \u201cshared\u201d subset is somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>As DM, there is this scepter on a throne in a room in the dungeon I\u2019m running. The players saw it, walked up to it, but have not dared touch it. The exact amount of times they\u2019ve seen that thing, I don\u2019t really need to note or remember, or <em>even the fact that they\u2019ve seen it once</em> because all I need to remember/know to do my role is that in room so-and-so there is a scepter that looks so-and-so. The predicate <code>shared-p</code> is of a kinda low relevance in the case of that scepter.<br/><br/><strong>Conversely, in a Baker/Care-Boss-principle adhering game</strong> (if such a game even exists), the relevant data structure that the participants operate upon is the set of entities that <em>have been shared</em>. When they enter room so-and-so, instead of a scepter, I can say there is a devil there, or some ice cream, or a ghost. Sure, I\u2019d bound by the rules of the game when doing so, for example when making the \u201cAnnounce Future Badness\u201d move I can\u2019t say \u201cThere is nice &amp; good tasting ice-cream here that restore 10 hp\u201d.<br/><br/>Btw, I\u2019m not even sure that Apocalypse World itself adheres to the Baker/Care-Boss-principle. \u201cAlways say what your prep demands\u201d page 81. If I wrote down a scepter in room so-and-so, that becomes part of the relevant data structure even though it isn\u2019t <code>shared-p</code>.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>What I\u2019m picking up so far, but to my very poor memory, has not been made explicit is that what is being described as canon is being used in two different ways WRT to RPGs.</p></div></blockquote>Good old <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21073/four-mirror-scenarios-and-two-groups/p1" rel="nofollow">\u201cFour mirror scenarios and two groups\u201d</a>\u2026<br/><br/>It\u2019s been said a bunch of times but <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/485435/#Comment_485435" rel="nofollow">recently and explicitly here</a>. \u201cIn our new model, [\u2026the] gamestate has been extended beyond the spoken entities to also cover some unspoken entities.\u201d\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The sticking point of calling type 1 canon is that no one but the GM knows about it.</p></div></blockquote>This is kind of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation" rel="nofollow">equivocation fallacy</a>. You are used to reading theorists that discuss operating on a particular data-structure (the set of shared entities), the \u201cSIS\u201d. That makes you think that words like \u201ccanon\u201d, \u201cimagined space\u201d, etc primarily denote &amp; connote qualities associated with that particular set. Leading to misconclusions like \u201cIf it\u2019s canon, it needs to have been shared?\u201d \u201cIf it\u2019s diegetically coherent, it needs to have been shared?\u201d \u201cIf it\u2019s part of the imagined space, it needs to have been shared?\u201d but for our new model, the relevant set that we operate on is a bigger set of entities where the <code>shared-p</code> predicate <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/485392/#Comment_485392" rel="nofollow">isn\u2019t inherently ontological but is instead of much lower relevance</a>.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>One way to address this, which is nothing new to theory, is consider that each player has their own imaginary space while the table has the Shared Imaginary Space.</p></div></blockquote>Sure, that\u2019s true but it\u2019s not particularly central to the way we operate when running and playing blorb games.

What the chessboard is utterly agnostic about is the significance of the positioning of the pieces.</p></div></blockquote>OK, so there are two kinda confusingly similar chess analogies going on here. In both analogies <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation" rel="nofollow">the \u201cchess board\u201d is a data structure</a> that the participants are operating on.<br/><br/>In your analogy, you\u2019re saying that the data structure relevant to you, the SIS\u2014the set of entities that have been shared\u2014is the chessboard, is the game-state, and that there are more things going around in the game than in that data structure and that those things might or mightn\u2019t have an effect on that gamestate, depending.<br/><br/>But in our analogy, the \u201cchessboard\u201d signified a much larger set of entities. It included the prep, for example.

You have the canon of the SIS.  This is the record of what <i>actually happened</i> as a result of play.  This canon is shared and known by all the players including the GM.

There are very few claims about the game world that every player has met in play.<br/><br/>And these different games certainly have affected each other - an angel was summoned in a Burning wheel game quite some years ago, it has been central for a partially overlapping group of players, while a completely separate group of players has been interested but is yet to meet it.<br/><br/>Or maybe you would like to say that all of these are different games. If so, how come that actions in one of them can affect the other in a highly meaningful way? One group fights against an army and at least stalls its progress, so others do not have to worry about it. Had the first group not done that, the war would have hit the others, forcing them to react. Right now they have been doing unrelated things.<br/><br/>"Things are true when everyone knows about them." seems to be an inadequate model, here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485537/#Comment_485537" name="Item_503" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-07T06:46:44+00:00" title="June  7, 2019  6:46AM">June 7</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you Thanuir\u2665                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485551/#Comment_485551" name="Item_504" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-07T14:13:44+00:00" title="June  7, 2019  2:13PM">June 7</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>In a Baker/Care-Boss principle game [\u201ca game where entities become diegetically canon only when shared\u201d] there can be mistakes, and you can handle them in different ways.</p></div></blockquote>\nNote that this misstates the Baker-Boss Principle, which is simply, "System is how we agree on what enters the fiction." We can agree that something "enters the fiction" only when it makes a difference in play (No Myth style) or we can agree that the GM's notes are "diegetic" in the sense of having a fictional existence before being communicated to any player.<br/><br/>What it means when a GM or player makes a mistake in terms of (a) contradicting what has gone before in the fiction (that is, both imagined and shared), versus (b) contradicting what has been written in their own or someone else's notes (imagined but not shared) are thus slightly different cases.

These are handled robustly by the part of the system that says something like, "If we discover an inconsistency between the fiction and the game state, we must correct it to bring them back into sync, usually by rewinding or amending the fiction."<br/><br/>On the other hand, breakdown of the game at the level of the system would look like this:<br/><br/>DM: You go into the room and see a race car.<br/><br/>Players: What?  That's ridiculous!  There's no race cars in D&amp;D!<br/><br/>DM: It's what's in the room.  We all agreed that the fiction would consist of exploring the game state, and we all agreed that the game state would include this module I downloaded and printed without reading."<br/><br/>Players: Well, we didn't know it had a race car when we agreed to it!  Come on!  We won't play unless you take out the race car.<br/><br/>The BCB principle is saying that this latter scenario is still possible, even with a system that implies the race car is part of the game.<br/><br/>Edit: OK, I see a similar clarification was reached in the other thread.

This is entirely in line with the Principle, not a contradiction of it.

If we agree that the GM's prep has a special diegetic status, then we've agreed that it takes priority over potentially contradictory material that someone may attempt to introduce "into the transcript" (which, somewhat confusingly), the Big Model takes to mean the account of (fictional) in-game events. What people say at the table as well as other game-mechanical and play-related texts, in contrast, is "Ephemera"). The important point is that <i>we agree</i> that the GM's prep takes priority.<br/><br/>So "the means by which the group agrees to imagined events during play" includes in some cases "the GM refers to her notes and tells us what's here." It's still Baker-Boss "system." A game without shared imagined events is arguably by definition not a role-playing game. <br/><br/>But if you want to create Chess: The RPG to prove me wrong, that's great. To quote Ron Edwards, via the manuscript of my hopefully forthcoming book about the Forge:\n<blockquote>Ron\u2019s comment at a panel at InterNosCon, an Italian gaming convention, in 2010 illustrates the extent to which he was motivated by an ideal of a broad understanding of the possibilities of RPGs as a form. \u2018We could be talking about designing and playing better role-playing games,\u2019 he told an audience of about 20 Italian indie gamers. Alternately, \u2018We could be talking about breaking that and making a different thing. . . . I\u2019d rather not do that.\u2019 Instead, he went on, \u2018I think that there is a productive dynamic between saying I am making a better role-playing game and saying, no, I am making something different. Rather than knowing which one you are doing, perhaps it is better to recognize that there may be a difference between the two but\u2014but it is a dynamic relationship over time . . . Someone could have been trying to make a better role-playing game, and what they did opens up the door to something completely different, or someone could have said, \u201cOh, no, I am completely different, I am not making a role-playing game,\u201d and what they do inspires someone to make a better role-playing game.\u2019 Ultimately, he said, \u2018We don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know. Just let that be dynamic. Let that\u2014relax about that.\u2019</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485581/#Comment_485581" name="Item_516" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-07T19:29:21+00:00" title="June  7, 2019  7:29PM">June 7</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My co-authors and I talk about an issue that seems close to what you mean when you say salience in the <i><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/266197/Fate-Space-Toolkit-o-Prototype-Edition" rel="nofollow">Fate Space Toolkit</a></i>:\n<blockquote>We\u2019ll use the term black box to refer to any potentially important science fiction setting element. These are technologies or scientific contrivances, and in some fiction their likely consequences are not fully thought out before their introduction. For example, script writers don\u2019t often consider things like how the nonscarcity economy implied by the existence of food replicators in the Star Trek universe affects the Federation (but see Manu Saadia\u2019s <i>Trekonomics</i> for an extended discussion of the replicator). Though a technology that can manipulate matter at a molecular level is both really powerful and really interesting, it\u2019s not the point of the show, so it gets moved into the background.<br/><br/>So in effect, a black box is Just the Way Things Are, without further consequence<br/>or implication to the setting. It signals that certain problems\u2014like \u201cHow do we<br/>get our food while we\u2019re in space?\u201d\u2014are not interesting in the fiction. At least, not<br/>most of the time. But in a Fate Space game, it is often worthwhile to keep track<br/>of black boxes for the times when they can lead to challenges or opportunities<br/>that might prove very interesting, indeed!<br/><br/>For example, any of these fictional details can be treated as a black box: <br/><br/>o Antigravity in the deck plates<br/>o Hyperspace technology<br/>o Personal teleportation belts<br/>o Extended human lifespan<br/><br/>However, once established, a black box can become a plot point in an adventure, even if most of the time it is ignored. Suddenly the grav plates are on the fritz; the power crystals are slowly depleting while the ship is trapped in hyperspace mid-jump; the calibration sensors on this TP-belt are out of alignment; or the captain\u2019s nanogerionic therapy regimen has caused a harmful mutation. Any of these can be an issue that requires time and attention during play. Thus, black boxes can imply, inspire, and collect aspects that make the setting feel more plausible and coherent.</blockquote>\nThe rules for when a black box or something like it opens up--becomes salient--probably fall into different categories based on Tweet's resolution categories: Drama, Fortune, Karma.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485582/#Comment_485582" name="Item_517" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-07T19:45:06+00:00" title="June  7, 2019  7:45PM">June 7</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2019 7:49PM by 2097.">edited June 7</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Bill_White%26amp">@Bill_White&amp;</a>;lt;br /&gt;I want those GM notes to also be governed by rules.

That was the whole of the game, for both: talking. Neither had a physical board.<br/><br/>The LBCBP obviously applies to the kids\u2019 take on memory chess.<br/><br/>One can also construct a set of rules, with the LBCBP in mind, to construct a fully isomorphic version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)" rel="nofollow">the oldies\u2019 version of the game</a> strictly as operands on the uttered statements.<br/><br/>For example:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/PbtA chess" rel="nofollow">PbtA chess</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>To <b>start the game</b>, say a letter from a through h followed by a 3 or a 4, or say the letter N, followed by a, c, f, or h, and a 3.<br/><br/>Then <b>the second player replies</b> by saying a letter from a through h followed by a 5 or a 6, or saying the letter N followed by a, c, f, or h, and a 6.</p></div></blockquote>etc etc. One <em>could</em> do that. And obviously a chess board [real or imagined] is a great tool when constructing that type of rule set, just like the threat map is a great tool in AW2e.<br/><br/>But.<br/><br/>for this game \u201coldies\u2019 memory chess\u201d, it\u2019s much more efficient, relevant, and valuable for rule designers to create rules that primarily operate <em>on the board directly</em> [again: real or imagined] and only secondarily creates utterances such as \u201cexd5\u201d.<br/><br/><strong>We want to do that.</strong><br/><br/>And when the No myth crew <a href="https://big-model.info/wiki/Lumpley_Principle" rel="nofollow">then say</a> \u201cno no no the only things that matter is what are being said, stop pretending that anything else matters, stop trying to make rules about anything else\u201d that can get kinda frustrating.<br/><br/>There\u2019s a looot of appeal to authority from Paul right now (not from you, Bill), \u201cBaker &amp; Care-Boss once said\u201d, \u201cChris Lehrich once said\u201d, \u201cFang Langford once said\u201d.

Rules for when and how to add, remove or change things in them." and the LBCBP.  Its an interesting section of game theory and design development.  Maybe even a disruptive area of thought - disruptive in the good sense of radically altering.<br/><br/>Having a game system where the GM actions are tightly prescribed is still System.  The idea of strictly formalizing how the GM can operate while not new has not been explored in depth.  Let the good ideas flow!<br/><br/>But both <a href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">@Bill_White</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/Vivicent">@Vivicent</a> have the right of the LBCBP.  That the GM game prep gets automatic or highest credibility is still System.  That the players could revolt at something the GM enters into play is a breakdown that the LBCBP covers.  When the players are not in consensus about the SIS play breaks down until the problem is resolved.  That's the LBCBP.<br/><br/>That the GM can and does exercise control of "off-screen"/extra-SIS events is fairly well established.  That you want to create a rigorous system for how that happens is interesting but ultimately a game design issue.  No problem.<br/><br/>The thesis that you're promoting about these "off-screen" actions that have been fully documented prior to play but not in any way (yet) been communicated, validated and integrated into the "fact space"/SIS/text has the same the same weight and validity is what is controversial.  It is the "creating a language in a closet" is not the same as communicating issue.<br/><br/>Of course there is a lot going on outside the SIS in the minds of every player especially the one bearing the burdens of the GM.  To me, this Individual Imagined Space is the awesome sauce of the game.  We plan our actions.  We consider the implications of our or another players actions.  We wonder at the significance of an event.  We worry about our character dying.  We surge with joy at getting the joooools!  We plan short and long term goals.  Perhaps we're thinking about an internal crisis point about our character. Maybe we are angry about an injustice perpetrated upon our character or are plotting revenge.  This is all very player facing and where are hearts are most engaged.  This IIS also covers such things as the players' character sheets and what not.  This is all player facing.<br/><br/>What I think you're getting at is very GM facing.  Rules, regs and procedures for GMing in a certain mode of play that all the players agreed on at the Social Contract Level before playing.  Very cool and have at it.<br/><br/>The proposal that is causing the rukus is claiming that the GM facing part of the game is <i>functionally</i> self-same as the player facing part of the game.  There is absolutely nothing controversial about the GM moving things in the backfield as long as such actions don't impinge directly on the established fact space/SIS.  An army can march on the players hometown while they are adventuring and that is perfectly acceptable as long as it doesn't violate system or the established facts/SIS.  In fact this makes for a living breathing world beyond the myopic view when we focus solely only the hobos.<br/><br/>But to propose that this uncommunicated IIS has the same credibility as shared and validated communications/proposals does run afoul of both the shared and communal parts that are the fundamental process of role-play.<br/><br/>The question that needs to be answered is how that information which is only known to a very specific one (uncommunicated/unshared) equated to the fact space which is a communal communication construct?<br/><br/>Yes private imaginings are a vital part of the game but if they are not put into play in any way ("putting into play" includes having an IIS construct and using it to influence/inform our proposal offered into the fact space/SIS) then from the player facing side we've got nothing.  If what the GM facing stuff does never enters the Proposal stage of play then as far as the players are concerned it never exists.  By analogy the writer's notes may exist but if they never made it into the text the reader never has any knowledge of said writings.  As far as reading goes the unincorporated notes don't exist and don't matter.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485587/#Comment_485587" name="Item_519" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-07T21:35:56+00:00" title="June  7, 2019  9:35PM">June 7</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The thesis that you\u2019re promoting about these \u201coff-screen\u201d actions that have been fully documented prior to play but not in any way (yet) been communicated, validated and integrated into the \u201cfact space\u201d/SIS/text has the same the same weight and validity is what is controversial.

I have never nor do I ever intend to make negative claims about the utility, joyousness or the nature of your game.  It is a role-playing game and apparently a very good one at that.<br/><br/>Please don't mistake the theory discussion of a proposed method for analyzing play as the same as a critique of the actual game itself.  That is simply not the case.  IOW I make NO claims at all on your game but I am trying to engage in an interlocutory about the powerful claims you make about the process.<br/><br/>For a fairly long time role-play theory has been based on the transactional model of communication and your current theory claims suggest that you disagree with that.  That's a huge claim to make.  Like....wow! Huge.<br/><br/>I doubt this will make things any easier but I will say them again for clarity's sake.

I think that this is a fruitful path.<br/><br/>The same definition could be used to discuss highly immersive play, or character optimization play where showing off your creation is what happens in play, while the actual optimization happens between the sessions.<br/><br/>However, in all of these cases, the Forge definition of system describes fewer of the salient features of play than it does for play with focus on narrative authority, or for essentially improvised play.<br/><br/>* The point of character optimization (in a game where the group appreciates it) is not to be able to add certain utterances into the fiction, but rather to be able to achieve system mastery and find interesting combinations and loopholes. Showing off your creation in play is of course nice and all, but does not require the convoluted jungle of mechanics.<br/>* The point of highly immersive play is not the input you give into the shared fiction. Hopefully that will be more interesting and dramatic due to your immersion, but, as far as I understand, the immersion itself is the point. And, indeed, Forge theory has had serious problems with understanding people who hold immersion as a dear goal in play. Harsh words have been exchanged in the past, I think.<br/>* The point with sandbox/klokkverk/blorb is not the fact that one can refer to prep and random tables to add credibility to certain statements, but rather the solid fiction and whatever ways it is being used - as an arena for challenges, as making the narrative the game creates feel more real, etc.<br/><br/>This suggests that one should pay more attention to other things when discussing these other types of games. And this is what some of the relevant communities have been doing:<br/><br/>* Character optimizers do their theoretical optimization stuff. They do not pay attention to who adds to the fiction and when.<br/>* People who want specific emotional experiences have traditionally discussed props, candle light, how a story should be structured, etc., and more recently the structured freeform/Fastaval/jeep people seem to also be aiming for creating certain intense experiences, and the fiction in their games is often fairly nebulous and not that central (when compared to traditional games or many Forge games). I might utterly wrong here; feel free to correct, if so.<br/>* OSR people pay a lot of attention on how to abstract the game world, what kind of content should be in the game world, and, for a different take, on how the referee should act to keep the game state solid and communicate this to the players. This "different take" is influenced by the Forge system thinking and it seems to mostly have been done at Story games and by some people with background in PbtA play; this is the "fruitful path" I mentioned above. The concerns about abstracting and nature of content are more widely discussed and more distant from Forge system and credibility of narration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485602/#Comment_485602" name="Item_525" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-08T06:39:13+00:00" title="June  8, 2019  6:39AM">June 8</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2019 6:39AM by Thanuir.">edited June 8</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>AW is generally much more self-aware (about the nature of roleplaying) than old school D&amp;D.</p></div></blockquote>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I'd say the opposite is true.

As role-play is a group communicative process for that Setting information to relevant to the play process it must be entered into the SIS.  Here's where the hangup seems to be manifesting.  What does communication mean?  It can mean spoken words, written text, somatic actions by the players, dice, cards, silence when that act of silence communicates information - such as when a character refuses to answer a direct order under heavy penalty to divulge information, describing the effects of something unknown to the players is having on the Setting, etc.<br/><br/>Even if this communication takes place out of game session the LBCB Principle still holds once play begins.  Basically the LBCB Principle covers whether or not the out of game information is usable by the PC's <i>in</i> game.  This happens all the time with players reading the rules and setting information about the game.<br/><br/>That the GM has more Setting information or can create Setting information through random tables or direct creative efforts is nothing new or controversial.  That the GM bears the responsibility for maintaining this continuity of Setting is nothing new.<br/><br/>Since RPG play has always been played as a <i>process of change</i> and not a state or condition of being that process of change has always been communicated, regulated and agreed upon.  It's not enough for the players to sit and stare at each other.  While it is necessary, it is not sufficient that only the GM communicating to call that process roleplay.  If that were the case someone reading out loud to an audience would be called roleplay.<br/><br/>I don't deny and have never denied what I am now calling Setting persistence.  I'm saying that Setting Persistence doesn't matter to player agency if that persistent information does not affect the SIS <i>in some way</i>.<br/><br/>So my two questions to you are - <br/><br/>1.  How was the information about the Angel summoning communicated amongst your various groups?  (Especially with regards to the completely isolated group)<br/><br/>2.  By what manner of system did you use to allow such information to be acted upon by the PC's?  (Remembering that you as the GM just hand waving the problem away is still System)<br/><br/>Your example didn't include who did the actual summoning of the Angel, but whoever did it the effect of that summoning was communicated, validated and integrated into the SIS.  Setting was changed.  Nothing you've described invalidates the notion of the SIS.  For the player group that was completely isolated from the Summoning event game session <i>someone</i> communicated that information to them if, as you've said, the players are expressing interest in it.<br/><br/>What I'm <i>not</i> saying is that the Fact Space/SIS is the everything of role-playing.  We have the Social Contract.  We have Creative Agenda's.  We have our plans about what we want to accomplish during the game.  Etc.  All these are vital to us engaging in roleplay but until we've starting Exploring (the act of using the Elements of Exploration which includes System - the LBCB Principle) we haven't started play.  They are all <i>necessary</i> but as activities they are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not sufficient</span> to be regarded as roleplay<i>ing</i>.  We can all agree to meet at Alice's and all agree to play (pick whatever RPG you want) at 8pm on Tuesday night.  But that's not roleplay<i>ing</i>.  We can agree on the Technique that there is a separation of information between the players and the GM.<br/><br/>I'm saying the SIS is the arena where roleplaying happens which results in changes to Setting.  Pre-game Prep whether taken from a book, made up whole cloth, a mix of both, a map or taken from another game session is still Setting.  It should be noted for completeness that there are games that distribute the duties/roles of the GM around the table but again those games have a System that regulates and empowers that activity.<br/><br/>But to answer your question about table having its own SIS then short answer is yes.  To what extent that information is shared amongst your various groups is a matter of the Social Contract.  But whatever information that is shared/common to the groups is a matter of Social Contract.  As far as the Agency allowed to players to employ such information that is a matter of the LBCB Principle describing what information is allowed to the PCs and what is restricted to the Players only.<br/><br/>Finally it should be noted that whatever information that is allowed to be shared between groups the players still have to all agree on it as well.  For one reason or another a player could contest some aspect of the Setting you've provided which is still under the LBCBP.  This may be extremely rare to actually come about but tacit passive approval is still occuring.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485642/#Comment_485642" name="Item_534" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-09T08:36:29+00:00" title="June  9, 2019  8:36AM">June 9</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Jay,<br/><br/>I mostly agree with you, and I do not think that discussing that further is fruitful.<br/><br/>Rather, (in hindsight I believe) I was grasping at the following simple observation: The Forge definition of system and characterization of the process of roleplaying is moment-to-moment, and highly local in time.<br/><br/>As you correctly write, the definition does not care why we are introducing something into the fiction, it just asks if everyone involved accepts the input. The criterion for acceptance is defined as the system.<br/><br/>This is also why all the games that have a game master (who has narrative authority over the world) and players (who are restricted to their characters perspective and taking actions through the character) look like pretty much the same game from a Forge lens: The *moment-to-moment* means of accepting input is mostly the same. Maybe people get credibility for their statements by reading dice and character sheets in different ways, but that is surface detail, not fundamental in any way.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if the player has metagame currencies that influence the character's performance, or if different parts of character performance require rolling dice than "usual", than the Forge definition of system starts seeing differences.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>Let us take a look at two games, one a no myth game, the other a sandbox/blorb/klokkverk game, but with the traditional player-GM divide and nominally the same rule system in both.<br/><br/>The big model definition of system sees very little difference; maybe it adds a side clause about the GM prep adding to credibility of the statements in one, or about the GM having to respect their prep.<br/><br/>Similar phenomenon happens with two otherwise identical games, where one contains an intricate system of character creation and in the other the player or game master simply writes down a bunch of values that seem to fit the character. This has little effect on who can say what and when so that it is accepted into fiction; basically, when introducing a character, it has to have a certain number of points total in one game, but not the other.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>Suppose we want to, for whatever reason, discuss the intricacies of running a persistent game world, or of having a compelling character optimization in a game.<br/><br/>As another issue, suppose we are considering a fate token rule for a game - what they are good for and when they are earned.<br/><br/>In the latter case, the Baker-Care-Boss principle definition of system is quite useful. Does the player have the right to declare their character successful, or that a minor fact is true, or that a major fact is true, or that their relationship appears in the scene, etc.<br/><br/>In the first case, thinking through the same definition gives far less - questions of realism or balance  between options are more relevant.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>I would be tempted to say that the locality of time of the big model definition explains why almost all Forge games are short-form games, but this is likely a poor explanation.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>From a sandbox point of view, Apocalypse world and its descendants are the only (probably: "among the few rare"; exceptions likely exist) relevant games with their roots in the Forge, because they pay attention to creating and maintaining the game world via clocks and fronts and what not. Other games just assume you do it.<br/><br/>Yeah, okay, Dogs in the vineyard mentions revisiting towns, Burning wheel has circles and relationship rules and resources as an attempt at abstracting essentially non-modern economics. Not entirely irrelevant in that way.<br/><br/>I wonder if anything useful (from sandbox point of view) has come out of the Fate community. Star system generation in Diaspora, maybe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485643/#Comment_485643" name="Item_535" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-09T09:22:08+00:00" title="June  9, 2019  9:22AM">June 9</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It just bugs me when someone says\n<ol><li>System is defined by the LBCBP to only cover what we imagine in play</li><li>The rules are defined by the LBCBP to be a strict subset of system</li><li>Therefore a game can not have rules that cover things outside of what we imagine in play</li></ol><strong>That has actually happened in this thread.</strong><br/>And on the Forge.<br/><br/>Not that people are interested in the LBCBP or impressed by it, but that they then also conclude that it means that it therefore <strong>must be</strong> allowable for the DM in <em>any</em> \u201creal roleplaying game\u201d to do unblorby things.<br/><br/>And I\u2019m like\u2026 this is a kinda tired old clich\xe9 but the whole bumblebee thing?

Making the ambush team and making the territory and making the mechanisms by which they interact with each other and the players' characters to determine if the ambush is successful creates many, many opportunities for mistakes which can end up skewing the situation you wanted to model in the first place: sometimes you get ambushed, sometimes you don't.<br/><br/>For some people at least, it's easier to just say: sometimes you get ambushed, sometimes you don't.<br/><br/>That approach does have other disadvantages: for most people it feels less "real" or "solid".

It's not necessarily a net positive, but from a designer's standpoint it's really handy, and it arguably does a better job of teaching people how to play.<br/><br/>Now, what is your issue with the "data structure layer"?

And that's unfortunate - after all, I feel we're all friends here, and, as far as I can see, no one's deliberately trying to put anyone down. I don't want you to feel "set upon", as by a pack of hungry wolves.<br/><br/>However, here's my problem:<br/><br/>* I love what you're doing from a design perspective, and I love exploring and finding new "blorb/klockwerk" tools, because they can really improve a certain style of gaming. So I want to engage with that and support it and offer my own ideas. It's some great stuff, and it's what's got me coming back to Story Games every day lately. Wonderful!<br/><br/>* However, I either don't follow or strongly disagree with your theoretical thoughts on the matter. Sometimes it feels like you're trying to redefine the way we look at RPG play in order to legitimize your favoured playstyle. <br/><br/>This is tricky, because, on one hand, that doesn't mean I can't engage with the practical stuff (e.g. designing random encounter tables). On the other hand, there's a danger of getting mired into a whole semantic swamp and missing out on cool techniques. However, I also like theoretical thinking about RPGs, and I like challenging existing ideas and coming up with new models because they can give us new avenues for design and play. <br/><br/>So, what to do?<br/><br/>If I ignore the theory stuff, you feel like your points are being ignored and overlooked (fair!). If I engage with it and critique what I see as its weak points, then I sound obstinate and I make you feel like you're on the defensive.<br/><br/>So, I choose to take a middle ground by pointing out that I don't agree with the theory, and to preferentially engage with the more practical topics.<br/><br/>It sounds like you'd really like me to challenge the theory, though, and address that. I'm happy to do so; in exchange, I'll ask you to give me the benefit of the doubt and not to assume that I'm being close-minded or mean-spirited. I very much see this as a friendly and interesting dialogue!<br/>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>In blorby play, interacting with our primary-level data-structure, the canon, the mutual (not necessarily \u201csense-four-shared\u201d) imagined space (The MIS!

I really like this; I think it's the clearest restatement you've made so far of what you're reaching for with this whole "gamestate" idea. <br/><br/>Perhaps the analogy is one of a board game, which has defined positions and moves, and we talk only to communicate our moves to each other. <br/><br/>I'd initially thought that no change of the Situation (in Forge terms) can happen without talking, but perhaps you are right that sometimes such change happens with very little overt communication. (e.g. I can cross off a potion on my character sheet and increment my HP, and we all know that, in the SIS, my character drank a potion.)<br/><br/>The question, then, becomes whether this somehow violates the idea of the Lumpley Principle. I'd always understood it as being entirely in line with it: the original text of the Principle doesn't say anything about talking, and it seems silly to pretend that things like illustrations, maps, miming a sword swing, taking on the body position/posture of a character I'm playing, and so forth don't affect what we're imagining.<br/><br/>I can see, though, that the Wiki you're quoting says that "nothing happens, in the fiction of role-playing, unless someone says it and it's heard by others". I would have thought this was just sloppy writing (after all, 99% of the time we DO say these things out loud), but I can see how - if you took it literally - you'd think it was bogus.<br/><br/>However, I think the original text of Principle - how we agree to imagined events during play - is fairly self-evident. Can you think of any counterexamples?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485730/#Comment_485730" name="Item_546" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-10T21:27:48+00:00" title="June 10, 2019  9:27PM">June 10</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>If this is a radically different model than your model of what \u201croleplaying as an activity\u201d is, then, well, that <strong>is</strong> noteworthy, wouldn\u2019t you say? <br/></p></div></blockquote>\nIndeed! This is why some of us are reacting the way we are. It's an extremely noteworthy and bold claim!<br/><br/>It might qualify as a really interesting claim, if not for the perception (and I'll keep my mind open about whether this is fair or not) that this is just the "old" way of looking at gaming.<br/><br/>Before the Forge days, there was a pretty dominant perception that RPGs didn't really work like other games. Instead, we had an imaginary reality, a virtual world, and the "game rules were the physics of that world". I remember this being fairly doctrinal in the 90's, at least. Pretty much everyone I knew who played RPGs spoke of the process in this way.<br/><br/>For instance, the rule for an attack roll was engaged when a fictional entity made a physical attack against another entity, and the outcome determined the fictional/diegetic outcome (the target was hit, let's say). This kind of rule is written with no concern for the actual, real-table activity in which it's taking place; it presumes the "reality" of the diegesis/game world as a given.<br/><br/>What it led to was a real stagnation in RPG design and all kinds of evolutionary dead-ends. (Like I said earlier, it's pretty hard to design something with the clarity of AW's IIEE when looking at gaming from this lens.)<br/><br/>So, the idea was that the Lumpley Principle was a broader understanding, breaking us free of that kind of limited thinking.<br/><br/>Now you're trying to bring on board something that sounds suspiciously like that old-time kind of thinking about RPGs. Do you feel that your "game state" theory/concept is meaningfully distinct from that kind of pre-Forgean view of RPG play? If so, how so? \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>While there\u2019s a bit of an overlap, this is fundamentally different from \u201cyarn-spinning\u201d as an activity, where you add statements to a story, incorporating or embellishing or correcting previously added statements to said story.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nSo, this is the rather bold and interesting claim: that there is a fundamental difference between RPG play or "make believe" and collaborative storytelling.<br/><br/>I can see some rationale for that! Certainly, a game where I am strictly limited to actor stance (e.g. many/most of the trad RPG tradition) and a game where we get to make stuff up together *feel* quite different.<br/><br/>But, off the top of my head, I can think of a dozen examples of corner cases that defy categorization, hybrid forms, and so forth. So I'd have to hear WHY you feel these are fundamentally different, and then how you can think of any kind of hybrid game (which most RPGs are, at root) within a framework where those two things are fundamentally different activities. How do you explain something like AW or Sorcerer or The Pool from that point of view?\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>or conflating motives with tools, respectively</p></div></blockquote>I did portray both motives and tools but I thought I was pretty clear about which was which [and sometimes a tool can be a motive and sometimes a motive can be a tool] so what\u2019s this in reference to?</div></blockquote>\nSure!

I'll come back to this in another post.<br/></div></blockquote>\nI'm running out of time, so I'll make this short (feel free to ask questions).<br/><br/>In short, your analysis part one (from a blorby perspective), I feel, omits some pretty important details, by pretending to ignore the real people playing and their interactions.<br/><br/>It describes what's happening pretty well, but the references to a "game state", even though it often doesn't exist outside of the utterances of the players (e.g. those cracks in the floor simply did not exist in any sense until the player asked about them), have to be supported. I also think that, aside from the mentions of the 'game state', it's a perfectly accurate and 100% Lumpley Principle-compatible analysis of what's happening there.<br/><br/>However, then you move to what you and Jay are calling the "transactional model" and suddenly you are conflating the means of play (we talk) with the motives (we're trying to tell a story).<br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/>"John wants to use narration to portray a canny and cautious young man so he adds a statement to the fiction that implies that he is attempting to examine the floor."<br/><br/>This is complete straw doll, in my opinion. You've somehow decided (perhaps because of that line on the wiki page!) that accepting the Lumpley Principle means that all roleplay is a structured narrative that we consciously construct.<br/><br/>I don't know why - either it's that one line in the wiki, or your idea that Forge theory means we can't have rules about things other than what we say (which is downright silly - obviously we can make rules like "at 30 minutes past the hours, change seats with your partner"), or your recent interest in separating "full blorb" from "freeform storytelling" games, even though thousands of hybrid games exist and are played every day.<br/><br/>But, coming back to your "transactional model" analysis of finchian trap-finding, that is not true at all. The "John" in the example is doing no such thing. There's no "story being told" - we're exploring an imaginary space which it is the GM's responsibility to describe as accurately and consistently as she can. John's describing his character's actions to the GM, which is the way the group has agreed to "imagined events during play": his role is to describe his character's actions, and he's doing so because he wants to avoid his character getting stuck in a trap (a likely hint that this might be a Gamist kind of venture, or at least one where John's responsibility is to advocate for his character's survival and success).<br/><br/>Sure, we could make a game where that's not the case - something like Donjon, perhaps - but that would be a different game.<br/><br/>In short, you've created a (nearly) accurate analysis and said that it conforms to your model, and then a rather caricatured and strange analysis where for some reason two people playing D&amp;D are trying to "tell a story" as their primary motive and don't seem to understand how Finchian trap-finding even works, and are trying to say that this analysis discredits the Lumpley Principle.<br/><br/>One thing I would be very interested to see, which I keep coming back to, is how the "game state" model can explain uncorrected errors in play. Like my example where the GM reads "green dragon" instead of "green goblin", but *never realizes the mistake*. Let's say you and I play a D&amp;D campaign, and such an error occurs. (And never mind that such errors, large or small, intentional or unintentional, happen all the time!) Is it really your position that it means something, years later, to say, "Sandra and Paul played D&amp;D back in 2019, but we, scientists looking back at them, now in the year 2097* can say that their memory of the game is incorrect; in fact, the 'game state' they were interacting with had a <i>green goblin</i>, not a dragon, and they just repeatedly made error after error, including descriptions, character decisions, numbers of hit points, and so on. The REAL game they played had a green goblin, not a green dragon; they're just misremembering."<br/><br/>How can the "game state" model account for the persistence of such errors? Or even non-errors like those cracks in the floor or the identity of the green dragon (as having been rescued by the PC's father, in my example)? <br/><br/>I hope that helps rather than aggravates.

It <i>is not identical to</i> the imagined events. It <i>is not</i> a virtual world where those events take place.<br/><br/>We're playing D&amp;D 5e. My guy, Alice, has 0 hit points. (That's part of the game state.) This applies a constraint that, in imagined events, Alice is incapacitated.<br/><br/>If I share this portion of the game state, saying "Crap I'm at 0", this makes manifest to all present that, in the diegesis, Alice is incapacitated.<br/><br/>It restricts me, preventing me from saying, "Alice gets up and stabs the orc." Because contributions to imagined events that contradict the constraints of the game state are invalid.<br/><br/>Do we agree that this is a totally, completely different thing from saying "There's an imaginary reality, a virtual world, and the game rules are the physics of that world"?<br/><br/><small>I'll also note that Sandra and I are totally not on the same page re: game state and the LBCB Principle. I think the principle works as originally stated: "System (including but not limited to 'the rules') is defined as the means by which the group agrees to imagined events during play." So written, the LBCB Principle is 100% compatible with the idea of game state; the game stat's constraints on imagined events are just a means by which we agree to those imagined events.<br/><br/>I also think that the entire Big Model Wiki entry on the LBCB Principle is crap. It is NOT the principle itself; it is rather bad commentary on the thing, and totally fails to state the thing itself.<br/></small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485736/#Comment_485736" name="Item_549" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-10T22:21:36+00:00" title="June 10, 2019 10:21PM">June 10</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2019 10:22PM by Paul_T.">edited June 10</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<small>Agreed with you 100% on the "small print" stuff at the bottom of your post.

It is garbage and the way it was discussed on site did not think of the principle in that way.  It was discussed and treated in the way Jeff quoted from the Provisional Glossary.<br/><br/>FREX - just recently in a game session I posted about a PC being bit by a vampire, trapped under rubble and dug about by another PC.  Near the end of the digging out, where the bitten PC (played by Dax) was being pulled out the Player of the PC doing the rescuing (played by Blake) rolled three 1's in about 5 rolls.  The Player of the rescued PC then rolled two 1's back to back.  At this point the GM looked at Dax and all he did was raise his eyebrows in question.  Dax in return just dipped his chin in the smallest of nods.<br/><br/>It was perfectly clear what was being asked and answered to both the GM and Dax.  Since you rolled two 1's and Blake rolled so many ones are you going to have your character (Silitare) bite Tomas (Blake's character)?  The tiny head nod was a "Yes" and Tomas' current state and future were radically changed.<br/><br/>The LBCB Principle in action using <i>no words</i>.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay

bit stronger than "the game state includes things outside of the imagined reality."<br/><br/>In fact, there's absolutely nothing that appears in both the imagined reality and in the game state! They operate on different types of symbols.<br/><br/>Diegetically, we have a character named Alice. She's a tall warrior who carries a spear and loves candied lemon peel!<br/><br/>In the game state, we have a an entity or token, let us call it `ALICE. The game state includes propositions about `ALICE, like:<br/><br/>(HITPOINTS `ALICE 0)<br/>(EXHAUSTIONLEVELS `ALICE 1)<br/>(SPEED `ALICE 30)<br/>(AC `ALICE 16)<br/>(ATTACKBONUS `ALICE +6)<br/><br/>And stuff like that.<br/><br/>`ALICE is not the imagined character Alice.<br/><br/>However, under our agreed-upon system, there is a causal relationship between the game state token `ALICE and the imagined character Alice. Game state propositions concerning `ALICE constrain imagined events with regards to the character Alice.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>If we wanted to, we could play a game with no gamestate at all, but the exact same imagined events.<br/><br/>Or a game with the exact same imagined events, and a gamestate which includes no token `ALICE. (<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">For instance, The Pool, which has one token for each player, one binary predicate, SIZE_OF_POOL, which takes as arguments a player token and a nonnegative integer; and nothing else.</span> The Pool was a shitty example, since pool size doesn't directly constrain game state. Consider a hypothetical game with one element of game state, a predicate DANGER_LEVEL that can take a boolean argument of True or False; when True, the GM is allowed to harm player characters in the fiction; when False, not.)<br/><br/>Things that are in the diegesis, imagined events, do not necessarily have any correspondence with anything in the game state. The game state is not "imagined events plus some other stuff." It's not even "A portion of imagined events, plus maybe other stuff."<br/><br/>It's a set of propositions: predicates which operate on tokens, logical primitives like numbers and booleans, and other propositions.<br/><br/>The system, in the LBCB Principle sense, includes ways in which this set of propositions constrain what counts as a valid contribution to imagined events. And the system contains ways that we are allowed to, or obligated to, observe and share and mutate the game state.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485739/#Comment_485739" name="Item_552" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-10T22:52:39+00:00" title="June 10, 2019 10:52PM">June 10</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2019 10:53PM by Jeph.">edited June 10</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In one game, you've written in your prep, "100 GP are in the vestibule." This causes the game state to include:<br/><br/>(CONTAINS `VESTIBULE (GP 100))<br/><br/>Which, combined with our system, creates obligations for the GM regarding information they must share when the players' characters observe the imagined location which corresponds to the game state token `VESTIBULE.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>In a another game, you've written in your prep, "100 GP are in the vestibule." No game state is created. No obligations are created. When the players' characters walk into the vestibule, maybe you'll say, "You see a hundred pieces of gold!" Or maybe you won't. No biggie!

Point in fact a lot of early (I don't know the current state) Narrativist game design capitalized on this very idea.  There is nothing particularly controversial about your formulation which was nicely stated.<br/><br/>That these two layers, GameState and SIS, function using a completely different set of (ugh) symbols and operate at different levels of the abstract and the concrete is still not particularly controversial.  You might want to consider such things as Creative Agenda priorities and what not in the GameState.  It is an important part of play. <br/><br/>However they do constantly communicate with one another and are constrained by each other.  Nor does this GameState need to be physical.<br/><br/>My question to you is would you consider the bidding system of Dogs in The Vineyard to be functioning at the level of GameState?  Do you perhaps consider the following from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universalis" rel="nofollow">Universalis</a> to be functioning at the GameState level?\n<blockquote>Coins are the measure of story power in Universalis. By spending coins, players can create Facts in the game. These may be about characters, the setting, or the scene being played. Each player begins with a number of coins (typically 25), and gains more after each scene plays out (typically 5). Players may also gain coins by winning Complications</blockquote>\nIf you do then I'm not seeing anything new.  If I'm wrong, if you're willing, could you offer an example from DitV of a GameState?  I ask about Dogs because I'm loosely familiar with it having never played Universalis.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485747/#Comment_485747" name="Item_555" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-10T23:39:01+00:00" title="June 10, 2019 11:39PM">June 10</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also wonder if Sandra agrees with your interpretation - my sense is that her "game state" was fairly analogous to (though not exactly the same as) the SIS.

The game state cannot <i>do</i> anything, merely be observed, talked about, and acted upon.<br/><br/>You might compare the game state to the memory tape that a program reads from and writes to. It's an extremely misleading analogy, the surface similarities will only confuse things. Primarily, <i>there is nothing that relates to the game state in the way that a program relates to a memory tape</i>.<br/><br/>And, <i>there is nothing that relates to a memory tape in the way that imagined events relate to the game state</i>.<br/><br/>Torturing the analogy to fix those misalignments is probably not a productive avenue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485758/#Comment_485758" name="Item_560" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-11T04:01:43+00:00" title="June 11, 2019  4:01AM">June 11</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, yes, I see what you mean. The System is our means of acting upon and changing both the imagined reality and the "game state", either of which <i>doesn't do anything on its own</i>.<br/><br/>Perhaps the board of a boardgame and its pieces might be a more suitable analogy, then. (Especially a boardgame that involves way to store information, like decks of cards, tokens used to track resources, and so forth.)<br/><br/>In that case, I see what you mean, although I don't think it's that different from my earlier "physics of the game world" analogy. It's not the laws of physics, maybe, but relevant values, like the mass of each object in the physics-analogy, its position and momentum, its density, and so forth. (In that analogy, the game state is the recorded values for such quantities, and the System is the flow of time. But it gets weird, because I think things like "the guards step outside at midnight each night" are closer to being values in the game state than elements of System.)<br/><br/>It's probably best to get away from twisted analogies, though, and talk about more practical matters: what does this mean for design, and how does it get us to new ideas or structures?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485759/#Comment_485759" name="Item_561" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-11T04:21:29+00:00" title="June 11, 2019  4:21AM">June 11</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well yeah duh a boardgame and its pieces are the better analogy, that's why I've been talking about invisible chess for a week.

My knight takes your queen. I say, "My knight knocks your queen off of her feet!"<br/><br/>We've got shared imagined events, here, right? I'm imagining it right now. You are too! Your queen is lying on the ground in the muck!<br/><br/>But the gamestate is exactly the positions of the chess pieces on the game board. It does not include (PRONE `THANUIRS_QUEEN).<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>The gamestate can have any logical structure you want.<br/><br/>It's exactly those propositions required to enact the rules.<br/><br/>Portions of it can pretty much mirror imagined events. That doesn't mean imagined events are always mirrored in game state.<br/><br/>In D&amp;D5e, we have rules about opportunity attacks that require us to track whether characters are next to each other. That means that (ADJACENT `ALICE `BOB) is part of the game state. In The Pool, we don't, so it's not part of the game state.<br/><br/>The fact that (ADJACENT `ALICE `BOB) is part of the game state probably requires the GM to communicate that fact, per our system.

The DM is referencing their prep and using that information to add a fact into the Shared Imaginary Space.<br/><br/>In both cases, \u201cthe secret door is in that wall\u201d, because at some point the DM decided to either put it there earlier during prep or decide that they would use this part of the module that says the door\u2019s there without modification.<br/><br/>As far as I can see, consulting the Game State is just a tool used in a particular type of System (defined in the B-C-B-Principal as \u201chow we decide what happens in the SIS\u201d), no different than dice, negotiation, consulting a chart, submitting to a particular player\u2019s narrative authority, etc.<br/><br/>The fact that we\u2019re considering the \u201cGame State\u201d as an extra-SIS \u201cvirtual world\u201d that all the players to have agreed to abide by (the same as they\u2019ve all agreed to abide by the results of dice rolls) doesn\u2019t make it not part of the System or invalidate the (I\u2019m just calling it this from now on because it\u2019s easier to type) Lumpley Principle.<br/><br/>Or not?

How does this work with OSR-style play with rulings over rules, where the precise mechanical interpretation of someone being prone is uncertain before the situation happens, and then the referee or the group as a whole makes a ruling about if and how the condition matters in this particular circumstance?<br/><br/>I think this is essentially the same question as you got to in the quote of Sandra, in the last paragraphs of your post.<br/><br/>I think a related phenomenon is that anything in the fiction (allow the sloppy language) might become relevant; there is a Lamentations adventure where the eye colour of characters might matter and a Trilemma adventure where blue clothes are relevant, to take examples where actual colour becomes a substantial part of play. Likewise Sandra's tar example.<br/><br/>I would be very tempted to say that the entire fiction is part of the game state in these kinds of games, but you clearly have something more limited in mind.<br/><br/>I think a relevant difference between this kind of game and Universalis or D&amp;D 4 might be that OSR play* (and, I guess, Sandra's play) is one of creative problem solving, in the sense that one has limited tools that one tries to use in clever ways to solve problems, and the culture of play respects interesting and exotic problems and solutions.<br/><br/>If one has narrative authority, then problem solving is of entirely different nature; I think Rickhard has some game like Dungeons and Bananas for this. But I might misremember a name or two.<br/><br/>D&amp;D 4, by default, has a component of tactical miniature problem solving (an important or an incidental one), while the focus might be elsewhere, but could also be in the tactical mini-game. I understand that Eero's game also has a light strategic dimension, but is focused more on following the stories of the characters and on enjoying the game world.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>* By OSR play, I mean the style of play that is fairly typical in OSR circles and rare elsewhere.

I'm not sure whether I'm being sloppy or ill-posed in this regard.<br/><br/>But to clarify something: I am <b>not saying</b> that anything that serves as the operand for a rule is part of the game state. More like, if the rules cannot be enacted based on the SIS alone, then the game state is that minimal additional logical structure that you need.<br/><br/>So when Dungeon World's Hack and Slash move writes "When you attack an enemy in melee..." that doesn't mean we need to include the relation <code>IN_MELEE</code> in our game state. Because we can resolve that purely at the SIS level.<br/><br/>But now consider D&amp;D5e, even a completely Theater of the Mind 5e with no grid. There's a rule that when you leave an enemy's reach, they get an opportunity attack. Consider a situation where the DM knows that an invisible assassin is standing next to Alice. Nothing about this assassin has been shared. But <code>(WITHIN_REACH `ASSASSIN `ALICE)</code> has to be in the game state, because we can't enact the opportunity attack rule without it.<br/><br/>I'm kinda musing out loud and clarifying my own thinking at the moment, rather than trying to Teach Something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485795/#Comment_485795" name="Item_584" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-11T18:36:09+00:00" title="June 11, 2019  6:36PM">June 11</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd be very curious to see how you distinguish between the DW case and D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Would it change if I simply reworded the D&amp;D rule like this?<br/><br/>* <b><i>When an enemy moves out of your reach</i></b>, you can attack them, right now, before they can get away.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485796/#Comment_485796" name="Item_585" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-11T18:38:53+00:00" title="June 11, 2019  6:38PM">June 11</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2019 6:42PM by Jeph.">edited June 11</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nope, no difference at all, because we still need to know that Alice was within reach of the invisible assassin, and we can't know that from the SIS!<br/><br/>EDIT: Unless we're explicitly allowing the GM to inject invisible assassins wherever and whenever they wish, I guess?

Appreciate it!<br/><br/>I'm trying to work this though so indulge me, if you will, with the Chess Board analogy.\n<blockquote>Things that are in the diegesis, imagined events, do not necessarily have any correspondence with anything in the game state. The game state is not "imagined events plus some other stuff." It's not even "A portion of imagined events, plus maybe other stuff."<br/><br/>It's a set of propositions: predicates which operate on tokens, logical primitives like numbers and booleans, and other propositions.</blockquote>\nI propose that the chess board with the chess pieces on it, in the various positions are analogous to the SIS or what I sometimes refer to as the "fact space."  It is the arena where the <i>act of playing</i> takes place.  Going a bit further let say we end with a White Queen moved to the same file as the Black King and there are no other pieces between the two.<br/><br/>The SIS has nothing to say about the relationship of the pieces, they just are where they are.<br/><br/>The GameSpace does focus on the relationship of pieces, uses the rules of the game and draws a conclusion (makes a judgement) - one element of the GameState is that the "King is in Check."  The rules say that you must inform your opponent about this (typically this spoken but for the sake of this example perhaps a token is put on the side board or placard is flipped over with the word "Check" exposed under it) but they also say that your opponent must address this GameState of Check above all other GameStates concerns.  I would also offer that the Chess Clock is also part of the GameState in competition chess.  If a player runs out of time is equivalent to running out of HP's.  In both cases a new GameState condition is created.  In the first that state is "You lose" it an RPG depending on CA and rules it could be "You lose" (als Kobolds Ate My Baby) or "Your character is dead" or "Your character loses consciousness" or "You lose the Conflict take fall out."<br/><br/>So the SIS/"fact space" is completely agnostic WRT such matters a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">proposed/considered/planned moves</span>, strategy, board state, winning, losing, offense, defense or any other matter requiring human judgment.  The "game" of chess begins and ends with the chessboard and the disposition of the pieces (one is not playing if they are not moving chess pieces - this is more solidly clarified in tournament chess with the Chess Clock).  For all that cogitation that happens in the GameState play isn't happening until the pieces are moved.<br/><br/>The SIS is the official IS.<br/>That GameState covers everything about what the SIS signifies.<br/><br/>The chessboard can exist without the GameState but play can't happen as there is no Agency.  The GameState can only exist because of its relationship to the specific chessboard.  The GameState state can be both informed by the SIS and inform what can be done in the SIS.<br/><br/>Its interesting to examine this GameState as that what really matters to us as players happens in this part of the game.  Such things as nebulous as CA make their influence felt here but this space has never been described or given a name before.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485798/#Comment_485798" name="Item_587" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-11T18:53:04+00:00" title="June 11, 2019  6:53PM">June 11</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I propose that the chess board with the chess pieces on it, in the various positions are analogous to the SIS or what I sometimes refer to as the "fact space."

I want to nip this in the bud!<br/><br/>Chess is a game that really, truly, actually has a game state.<br/><br/>The game state is the positions of the pieces on the board. <small>(The physical board and pieces are not the game state. They're signifiers, signs, which help us remember and track the game state. You don't need the physical board and pieces to play chess; you can track the game state in your head, if you want.)</small><br/><br/>That's not a metaphor. The positions of the pieces on the board is <i>literally the game state</i> of a game of chess.<br/><br/>Please, pleas, please, please do not construct some analogy where the positions of the pieces on the board in chess maps to something other than game state. That will become ridiculously confusing.<br/><br/>Chess has no SIS.<br/><br/>But we can play a version of chess that does have a SIS. Call in Vivid Imagination Chess.

Statements like, "The Gallant Sir Pawnington marches forth, his cloak billowing, shield raised, the tip of his spear tied with a fluttering banner of red cloth!" are mostly Color but can add elements that can confuse the analogy.  Maybe I'm not that bright but I want to distill this GameState idea down to its very base essentials before working back up to implications and design considerations.<br/><br/>Aside from my poor use of the idea of a physical chessboard do you have any comments on the ideas offered in my previous post?  Understanding that the like you said the SIS is the arena of referents and referents modified by which we keep by which keep track of GameState.  The GameState being that arena where we interpret the referents, make choices, do book keeping, etc. and which under the proper circumstances we then go back and make modifications to the arena of referents/SIS.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485800/#Comment_485800" name="Item_589" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-11T19:39:01+00:00" title="June 11, 2019  7:39PM">June 11</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2019 7:41PM by Jeph.">edited June 11</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think we're pretty much on the same page then!<br/><br/>Though I'm not sure what I think about SIS as the arena of referents.

The tricky one is the "location of the pieces".  In this particular circumstance this is where the SIS and the GameState come into contact.  The facts of the SIS informing the GameState.  Which in due course the GameState will then generate a proposition about the "location of the pieces" that travels through the LBCB Principle and possibly updates the SIS.  To me the SIS is nothing but facts.  Like your castling example that concept only resides in the GameState.  It is informed by what the players communicate into the SIS but the SIS itself is utterly agnotic WRT concepts.<br/><br/>The idea of the GameState vanishing is an idea that I'm having a terrible time wrapping my head around.  My conceptions about my character, my conceptions about Situation, the various courses of action that I'm conceptualizing definitionally belong in the GameState and can never go away while one is play<i>ing</i>.  For the GameState to "vanish" would be akin the the player utterly losing all knowledge of the game itself.  I am willing to admit that perhaps that my understanding is incorrect and any enlightenment would be gladly accepted.\n<blockquote> ...very different direction than Sandra is, given her suggestion that "who knows what" is of relatively little importance.</blockquote>\nI'm completely at sea by this statement.  What information does "who knows what" refer to?  The SIS?  The GameSpace?  The separation of GM and player knowledge?

It is a rule that in this room of the dungeon, there are three caskets behind a pit; you can't break that rule anymore than when I play, oh, Apocalypse World that you can roll with Hard when you make the Act Under Fire move. Of course, maybe you have a move that lets you do just that: rules modifying rules, and we have rules for that. Just so that if I have the cantrip <i>mage hand</i> and need to do something inside a closed casket, and there are no rules saying I can't, then I can do it and we check the rules (the prep/module) for what happens next.<br/><br/>The argument on the 2097e side at first seems to be that <i>only</i> things that have rules are real: die Regeln sind allen was der Fall ist.* This follows the, uh, lemme use "Laws" here to avoid confusion, the Laws of Salience and Tiers of Truth.<br/><br/>Basically: Facts are rules. Certainly the inverse is true: it is a fact that your character can't fly in D&amp;D without spell/magic/wings, it is a fact in Masks that the Outsider <i>can</i>. Those are both rules. New facts about the world are new rules, constraining it or expanding it.<br/><br/>And actually...that's true for Apocalypse World too, it's just that in Apocalypse World we basically have a rule that's like "whatever a player asserts about their character/the world in their reach, that is not contradicted by prior events (where <i>facts</i> are <i>rules</i> or existing rules (<i>rules</i> are <i>facts</i>) is true." (Note that the rule is constrained, of course, because Apocalypse World says that players can't just assert that "there's a robot empire to the east" unless prompted by the MC, who will remain the ultimate arbiter of that truth through their function as, in truth, the prompter of questions about the game state which allows more assertion of new facts/rules.)<br/><br/>Other games allow players to assert that there's a robot empire in the east because that's in the rules for them.<br/><br/>Now at least part of the assertion here is that by prioritizing prewritten rules (the module/prep) and creating clear and essentially immutable rules for the generation of new rules/facts, you get a different experience than games that allow you to make up rules on the spot, or at least more freely. That in AW it is a rule that whatever someone makes up in response to a game question is as true as prep or rules. But it's a case of AWs procedures being different, ultimately; AW has rules about how to generate new rules, just like 2097e. But as to whether the experience is different, well, duh, of course it is because the point is that the different rules systems generate different experiences. <i>That is the point of different rule systems</i>. <br/><br/>Note that the rules propositions of 2097e do in fact require the procedures Sandra has created, because in such a system the GM is limited just as the players are: the rules are all that the world is, and the GM is given no leeway to alter the world-state (the rules) beyond what has been allowed or what the system instructs us in how to create. But you know, so does Apocalypse World. It's just the tolerances are different and they aim at different experiences: but you can maybe see that the main differences is "how much of the world/rulestate is encoded at the beginning" and also the procedures for generating new rules.<br/><br/>As to the central question of the thread, I'll leave it to people who know theory rather than this simple big-city girl who mostly just likes to run games. It does seem to me that analyzing rules and procedures in terms of how they alter the rulestate may help us see which principles work better for which type of experience. Furthermore, deciding just what the heck "experience" means and the typology of what they look like I leave to smarter people like Sandra who you know created a whole canonical theory of it including friendship bonds. I mean, you could make AW style playbooks out of it; it states things well. Looking at places where experiences and expectations blend may show where blended rulestate systems might be acceptable; examining the furthest ends of the spectrums will help determine maybe what those principles look like. And you know, Sandra did that in this thread, I think?** Except for maybe hating on Lady Blackbird, but that's like Glenn Gould hating on Mozart, which never kept Gould from being a freaking genius <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=":wink:"/> <br/><br/><br/>*The Laws of Saliency further follow the principle "wovon man nicht regieren kann, dar\xfcber m\xfcssen die Regeln schweigen" in the Wallpaper principle.<br/><br/>**I got my MA in Literary Theory and walked away without a look back, save my post-two-beers rants about how Bakhtin can be used to expose the fundamental generic flaw in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485810/#Comment_485810" name="Item_599" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-11T21:34:53+00:00" title="June 11, 2019  9:34PM">June 11</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<small>(I think ya'll are successfully convincing me that "game state is all the operands of the rules" is a more useful concept than "the minimal additional logical structure beyond the SIS".)</small><br/><br/>My own personal takeaways from these 600 posts, plus a few hundred others in various related threads:\n<ol>\n<li>Games have Game State beyond the Shared Imagined Space: all the concepts and relations needed to enact the game's rules.</li>\n<li>The Philosophy of Blorb holds the Game State outside of the Shared Imagined Space is of first-class importance.

And how it's different than the above?<br/><br/>Can you explain the "shared-p flippable" bit?<br/><br/>What I think you're trying to say is instead of consulting the GameState to see what does or does not get added to the SIS, you should just think of it as interacting with the GameState directly. But that's never what is happening when you are actually engaged in playing an rpg.<br/><br/>As I understand it, interacting directly with the GameState would be something like marking off hitpoints. If there's a rule that says, "When a character is at zero HP, the character dies," and the DM sees your HP count, makes that translation to fiction, and announces, "You're at zero HP. You're character is dead." Your character is now dead in the SIS.<br/><br/>But the character didn't die in the SIS until the DM consulted the GameState (the character sheet says "zero HP") and translated it into fiction, then communicated that fiction (via speech or holding up the sheet for everyone to see, it doesn't matter what form the communication takes) to the players.\n<blockquote>In my model, making something that's in the game state known isn't a radical change to that thing. You had the cake. You still have the cake, only now it's a cake that people know about.</blockquote>\nBut you're still consulting the GameState in order to decide what's allowed in the SIS in that case. <br/><br/>I see no difference between:<br/><br/> "The cake was part of the gamestate and wasn't known about, but then I told you about it so it's part of the SIS"<br/><br/>and <br/><br/>"We wanted to add [what was in the fridge] to the SIS, so the DM consulted the GameState and told us [what was in the fridge], and thus it was added.<br/><br/>How are they different, other than one is from the point of view of the DM and the other is from the POV of the players?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div

The first one should have a motive like "We wanted to know what was in the fridge...".<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>There are two approaches to game design here.<br/><br/>If you take the approach that mostly the shared imagined space matters, then you are more likely to design games with shared narration, or with Apocalypse world -style triggered moves.<br/>You can still have a game with unknown established facts; in Apocalypse world, you still draw maps (even if they have blanks) and respect the preparation and so on.<br/><br/>If you take the approach that the game state is what matters the most, including the non-shared parts, then it is inconvenient to design games with widely shared narration because everyone with narrational authority has to respect the fiction, and this is more challenging to accomplish. (Go ahead and prove me wrong by design.)<br/>You are more likely to design fictional content, rather than only procedures: consider how useful an adventure is in D&amp;D when compared to Primetime adventures, to take an extreme example.<br/><br/>A definite game state is more useful if you want to design a game where the players solve a mystery or a puzzle, or reveal a secret. The focus on shared imagined space is more fruitful if you want a game where the players create a mystery. The shared imagined space approach is more fruitful, in the short run, if you want the play to create a particular kind of story, or even a particular story, though in the long run you might notice that you have painted yourself into a corner.<br/><br/>This is not to say that you could not achieve any of the stated goals with either design approach; I am only saying that some are more natural for a particular approach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485816/#Comment_485816" name="Item_602" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-12T06:35:04+00:00" title="June 12, 2019  6:35AM">June 12</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2019 6:35AM by 2097.">edited June 12</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Jeph">@Jeph</a>, thank you for that very satisfying summary!\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Neurotrash" rel="nofollow">Neurotrash</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>What I think you\u2019re trying to say is instead of consulting the GameState to see what does or does not get added to the SIS, you should just think of it as interacting with the GameState directly.</p></div></blockquote>Yes, that\u2019s how you should think of it, that\u2019s the takeaway. Here\u2019s an example of that happening:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Neurotrash" rel="nofollow">Neurotrash</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>\u201cWe wanted to add [what was in the fridge] to the SIS, so the DM consulted the GameState and told us [what was in the fridge], and thus it was added.</p></div></blockquote>That\u2019s right. There was something in the fridge that was unknown to us. By us finding out what that thing was, one thing changed about it: it is now known to us. It has been <code>shared-p</code>.<br/><br/>That\u2019s our model.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Neurotrash" rel="nofollow">Neurotrash</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>But that\u2019s never what is happening when you are actually engaged in playing an rpg.</p></div></blockquote>Did you see the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/485674/#Comment_485674" rel="nofollow">post about the difference between make-believe \u201clet\u2019s pretend that the floor is lava\u201d and yarn-spinning \u201cthis is a story about a family of birds who live in a forest. who is their friend?\u201d</a>.<br/><br/>Some games (never \u201ctraditional techniques\u201d games of any complexity, not even AW, but some shorter very hippiefied li\u2019l story-games) have an <em>apparent</em> rule set that truly are implemented solely on the yarn-spinning level. They\u2019re phrased as partipipants make statement according to a set of criteria on those statements. But even these games, the way they <em>work</em>, what makes them <em>fly</em>, is that the participants start constructing this big old world in their heads which helps them to remember things, to reincorporate things, and most of all: helps them to <em>care</em> about things.<br/><br/>For the \u201cno myth\u201d stuff to be true, they\u2019d instead see it as \u201cThere was nothing in the fridge until we opened it. Then the DM looked at her prep, saw that it had <code>'(fridge (container shelves cake electricity))</code>, consulted the rule about examining <code>container-p</code> items, and <strong>created</strong> a cake <strong>by</strong> adding it to the the SIS.\u201d<br/><br/>That model, because of Turing completeness, can also create the same outcomes as our model <strong>but it\u2019s utterly cumbersome</strong>.<br/><br/>The \u201ccloset language theorem\u201d variant of the model made a bolder &amp; wronger claim and with that model, the only type of fridge/gameplay that would be allowed is \u201cThere was nothing in the fridge until we opened it. The GM had a 100% blank mind. Heard that we opened a fridge and tried to make up something that would be good to be stored in a fridge. She came up with a cake.\u201d Because as soon as you have <em>any</em> inkling of what type of imagined cakes or whatever are in there, you are creating referents. So the \u201ccloset language theorem\u201d applies to pretty much no game ever.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Neurotrash" rel="nofollow">Neurotrash</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>As I understand it, interacting directly with the GameState would be something like marking off hitpoints.</p></div></blockquote>That\u2019s right.<br/><br/>Here are some ways to interact directly with the game state:\n<ul><li>moving from room to room in the dungeon</li><li>opening chests</li><li>chopping each other with swords</li><li>marking off hitpoints</li><li>dying</li></ul> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Neurotrash" rel="nofollow">Neurotrash</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>If there\u2019s a rule that says, \u201cWhen a character is at zero HP, the character dies,\u201d and the DM sees your HP count, makes that translation to fiction, and announces, \u201cYou\u2019re at zero HP. You\u2019re character is dead.\u201d Your character is now dead in the SIS.</p></div></blockquote><small>More likely it\u2019d be the <em>player</em> saying that to the DM rather than the other way around but that\u2019s a minor nitpic</small><br/><br/>That\u2019s right. The character was dead as soon as that HP reached 0. And by announcing it, the <code>shared-p</code> bit on that death is flipped. Which is of some relevance, but not as momentously fundamental as it would\u2019ve been with the no-myth model.<br/><br/>Here\u2019s another story. The character dies in the gamestate but only one person at the table, that character\u2019s player, knows about it yet, so according to the whole LBCBP stuff it hasn\u2019t been added to the SIS. The player sits in shock, dumbfounded. The rest of the party goes into the next room. \u201cAlice\u201d, Bob says, \u201caren\u2019t you coming with?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m <strong>dead</strong>, you blockhead!\u201d Alice says. Now it\u2019s added to the SIS.

A game designed strictly according to LBCBP principles would like designing a game where all the code resides in, or is called by, the screen drawing routines. That\u2019s just bad design. Also no such game exists if it has the slightest bit of traditional techniques. I called AW a disciplined design in the other thread but then I remembered that you also need \u201cplayers\u201d who have \u201ccharacters\u201d and those characters\u2019 gear sure as heckfire isn\u2019t defined solely in the \u201cscreen drawing routines\u201d; they are stand alone objects. Although Dungeon World comes close with its \u201cadventuring gear\u201d rule on 328. Which\u2026 isn\u2019t that rule kind of unsatsifying and pointless? It wholly de-tangibilitifies the sensation of having gear.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" rel="nofollow">Aviatrix</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Note that the rules propositions of 2097e do in fact require the procedures Sandra has created, because in such a system the GM is limited just as the players are: the rules are all that the world is, and the GM is given no leeway to alter the world-state (the rules) beyond what has been allowed or what the system instructs us in how to create.</p></div></blockquote>That\u2019s right. <a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">@Aviatrix</a> played with our group for the first time yesterday and got to see our game: a pale, flickering, kinda crappy cave-wall shadow cast by the blazing blorb ideal.<br/><br/>Including a mistake correction!

They\u2019re all making fiction but there is no actual sense of tension, urgency or consequence. It\u2019s almost like an intellectual exercise. Occasionally things come together and produce an alright story but the process of getting there isn\u2019t that great. You\u2019ll get players trying to be interesting by engaging in hi-jinx, because otherwise play is just kind of dull. If there\u2019s a GM they often compensate by introducing something crazy or trying to ramp up the tension, but it never really works. At best you get these kind of good improvisational bits in a sea of tedium.<br/><br/>We\u2019ll call this the Thespian problem.<br/><br/>Does Blorb solve the Thespian problem? In some cases it does.<br/><br/>Does Apocalypse World solve the Thespian problem? No it absolutely does not. In fact Narrativist design can\u2019t solve it because Narrativist games are for people that don\u2019t have the Thespian problem.<br/><br/>I think we both agree so far?<br/><br/>Where we might diverge.<br/><br/>If you don\u2019t have the Thespian problem then adding blorb might in fact be slightly detrimental.<br/><br/>The Thespian problem is in fact a problem and not normal Narrativist play. (This is hard because we don\u2019t want to judge fun but.. I\u2019ve been in groups of Narrativists that, well let\u2019s say they like a very laid back game rather than an intense one.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485821/#Comment_485821" name="Item_605" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-12T07:22:26+00:00" title="June 12, 2019  7:22AM">June 12</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite">@AlexanderWhite</a> <br/>You "add blorb" by changing the rules on how and when entities can be created&amp;injected into the game state.

I am not sure if it has been settled that it includes 2; I think it holds that in traditional roleplaying games it will turn out to include 2 if it includes 1, because the border is fuzzy, whereas in some formal games 1 and 2 might be disjoint. I do not know if 3 is meaningful or non-empty. My suggestion is to define the game state as 1 and see what follows.<br/><br/>The shared imagined space seems to be the intersection of 2 and a (or 2 and d, perhaps); I'll just abbreviate it as 2a (and ignore the complications of d, which are unlikely to be conceptually interesting).<br/><br/>All combinations of 1-2 and a-c are meaningful.<br/><br/>1a: The game master has declared that the giant is wearing a maille and has armour class 16. We can all see that you have a deeds artha, since the red token in front of you means that.<br/>1b: The giant has 54 hit points. We just started playing and everyone has made their character separately. Only you know that your character has lockpicking skill 65.<br/>1c: We use an online random character generation. Your character is there, you have copied it, but nobody has read it yet. The game master has placed a module in their sandbox but has not read through (all of) it, yet, and so does not know the stats of various creatures therein. (I have done the latter. There is one such module in my sandbox right now.)<br/>2a: My character is hiding under the bed. I have said so.<br/>2b: I have decided that my character has a tattoo on their back, but this has not come up in play yet.<br/>2c: The adventure module the GM has not entirely read through contains many examples.<br/><br/>No myth play is saying that 1a and 2a (and possibly 1b or 1c, but certainly not 2b or 2c) are relevant for play. Blorb/klokkverk is saying that all the combinations of 1-2, a-c, are relevant.<br/><br/>I am, on purpose, glossing over the detail about classifying things that were known but have been forgotten by someone or everyone.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>If this is useful, maybe someone wants to give good names for some of the categories above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485853/#Comment_485853" name="Item_616" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-12T18:02:38+00:00" title="June 12, 2019  6:02PM">June 12</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill\u2019s post, above, describes my concerns/objections pretty well. I\u2019m not sure I have much to add. I\u2019m not at all convinced that any two people are even talking about the same thing yet. That makes it harder to engage!<br/><br/>I do have some questions, though. Hopefully these will help people refine their thinking:<br/><br/>1. What, in practical terms, does this model or way of thinking give us that the following doesn\u2019t?<br/><br/>* This game gives certain players the authority to prep certain information, and that prep must be honoured when we play.<br/><br/>(If the answer is, \u201cnothing yet; we\u2019re still exploring!\u201d, that\u2019s totally fine, by the way.

How, in this model, can we explain what\u2019s happening when a mistake is made and isn\u2019t noticed?<br/><br/>For instance, the GM misreads \u201cgreen goblin\u201d as \u201cgreen dragon\u201d, and we play out the session. A green dragon is fought and lots of stuff happens. <br/><br/>a. We discover this much later, and have decide whether to retcon a good deal of gameplay (after all, lots hit points and other effects could have affected all kinds of long term developments since then). What if we decide it\u2019s too difficult and complicated to do so? What if the players argue that they legitimately fought a green dragon, risked their lives, and won - that it wouldn\u2019t fair to rescind the XP awards they received as a result?<br/><br/>b. Perhaps even more telling, when it comes to the nature of the \u201cmodel\u201d, what if <i>the group never notices the error</i>, at all? How do we describe/explain the resulting play, in this model or this way of thinking?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485858/#Comment_485858" name="Item_617" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-12T19:51:25+00:00" title="June 12, 2019  7:51PM">June 12</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>It's the idea that we're playing a game of let's pretend <i>together</i> and through the life-changing magic of rules, we can do that without just limiting ourselves to things that have been stated &amp; "added to the fiction in conversation".</p></div></blockquote>\nSee, here's the thing. From my perspective, playing a game of let's pretend <i>together</i> is functionally equivalent to saying fictional things in conversation. Without that step, we're not doing it together. The idea that you can make it so that the rules of the game obviate the centrality of that step seems likely to be wrong to me.<br/><br/>I am reminded of the story of the three umpires--these are the referees in the American sport of baseball who are charged with determining if the ball thrown by the pitcher has entered the batter's "strike zone," in which case the batter's failure to hit it counts against their three strikes, or whether it has not entered the strike zone, in which case the batter's refusal to swing is good judgment, since after a certain number of such "balls," the batter is allowed to advance to first base. Anyway, the three umpires are discussing their craft, and the first one says, "They're either balls or they're strikes, and I call 'em as they are." The second umpire shakes his head and says, "Well, some are balls and some are strikes, and I call 'em as I see 'em." The third umpire takes a minute to finish his beer, and then he says, "They ain't nothing until I call 'em."<br/><br/>The point of the story in this case is of course that rules require interpretation, and so where interpretive authority lies and how it's legitimated are important issues in making sense of how games that are like RPGs work.\n<blockquote>We can have a cake in a fridge without the fridge having been opened.</blockquote>\nBut isn't it more complicated than that? There's no actual fridge, only propositions about fridges and their contents that one or more people at the table are authorized to make. If you make a note to yourself, "There's cake in the fridge here," it's in the expectation that others will ask you, "What's in the fridge?" rather than assume that the contents are somehow "typical" fridge contents or tell you what's in the fridge. To the extent that what's in the fridge is different from what they expect--"Hey, there's cake in here!"--it might matter to them because of what it tells them about what's going on ("Ah, someone's planning a birthday party!") or because it's potentially helpful ("I'm starving! I eat the cake!") or harmful ("Yuck! I'm allergic to chocolate!"). If none of those things are true, and it's just an extraneous detail of no particular significance, then why does anyone care whether there's cake or not in the fridge?<br/><br/>[1] "What's in the fridge?"<br/><br/>[2] "What do you think is going to be in the fridge?"<br/><br/>[3] "Some moldy cheese, expired milk, and brown lettuce, probably."<br/><br/>[4] "No! There's cake!"<br/><br/>[5] "Really? Why?"<br/><br/>[6] "Because that's what I decided before you opened the door! <i>The cake was in there the whole time!</i> Doesn't the world feel more real?"<br/><br/>Maybe no one would ever ask [5], but [6] doesn't seem to me to be a satisfying answer in any case. To be fair, I suppose an alternative response could be:<br/><br/>[6a] "Because that's consistent with what has previously been established in the game-world, but there's no other value, meaning, or importance that should be ascribed to that proposition." <br/><br/>This is where the issue of salience pops up, which seems to me to be asking something like what if I say there's cake in the fridge and somehow it matters when I didn't expect it to? My own answer would be, great, wow, what clever players! what fun and interesting play! <br/><br/>So, I love the description of three tiers of prep to ensure internal consistency and diegetic coherence; that's a really valuable procedural insight. But seeking to assign GM-prepped information some sort of ontological priority in and of itself in the absence of attention to how authority is distributed around the table strikes me as conceptually unsound. It's very similar to my mind to how some OSR-adjacent gamers use the idea of a "world in motion" to avoid the idea that their game is "fictional."<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485860/#Comment_485860" name="Item_618" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-12T20:19:44+00:00" title="June 12, 2019  8:19PM">June 12</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul I have answered that exact green dragon green goblin question a few times now, and I\u2019ve discussed this whole error handling red herring at length in a few posts.

I don't know what 3 would be.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485870/#Comment_485870" name="Item_622" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-12T21:30:15+00:00" title="June 12, 2019  9:30PM">June 12</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2019 9:34PM by 2097.">edited June 12</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" rel="nofollow">Aviatrix</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Crap, now they'll think I'm cool enough to play with you!</p></div></blockquote>\nMaybe next time I bring in guest players we should do some more workshopping before                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" title="Silmenume"><img alt="Silmenume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">Silmenume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485871/#Comment_485871" name="Item_623" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-12T21:45:13+00:00" title="June 12, 2019  9:45PM">June 12</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2019 9:45PM by Silmenume.">edited June 12</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello,<br/><br/>If the GameState can be changed without reference to the SIS then what's to prevent the following from happening?<br/><br/>Alice - Because she's a sneaky thief and doesn't care for Bob's moralizing writes on her character sheet, "I switch Bob's healing potion with a lethal poison".<br/><br/>The GameState has been altered but not the SIS.<br/><br/>Bob - After a nasty and brutal battle crosses out on his sheet "One flask of healing" and returns his dangerously low HP's back to full.<br/><br/>Again the GameState has been altered but not the SIS.<br/><br/>Both notes were made before either player had any knowledge of an upcoming ambush.<br/><br/>According to some of what has been proposed both neither statement needs to be communicated to the SIS as we have authority to operate strictly on the GameState level without need to communicate these writings and thus such notations have automatic credibility.

Many years ago I had a Troublesome Player - a real shit-stirrer - who decided that his character hated <i>hated</i> <b>hated</b> one of my NPCs, so bad that he wanted to kill him. This NPC was a staple character in my D&amp;D world, a character I liked to imagine had plot insurance, though only in a de facto way (Players recognized him as a significant part of the setting, found him useful, returned to him for missions and advice, etc).<br/><br/>So TP challenges me to a fight, and everyone is excited. We broke from regular session and actually took a day to prepare ourselves for the big duel.<br/><br/>Next day we assemble at TP's house, and the battle is played out. Wishing to be as impartial as possible, and also to focus on the fight from an "immersed" perspective, I hand over the GM role to one of the other Players.  After a few rounds of swapping damage and narrative positioning, TP succeeds in scratching my character's face.  He begins smiling deviously. The room goes quiet. Everybody else knows something I do not.<br/><br/>I ask what's going on. TP reaches into his pocket and pulls out a piece of paper he had written the previous night and had already shared with the other Players. He hands it to me. It reads: "POISON UNDER NAILS."<br/><br/>I'm required to make a saving throw. I fail. My favorite NPC is dead.<br/><br/>Ok y'all -- what happened here?

First of all, <a href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">@Bill_White</a> is writing some good stuff - so far, I feel like he and I are exactly on the same page regarding all of this. I haven't had enough time to post about any of this really thoughtfully, so I'm glad Bill is doing so with more care and diligence.<br/><br/>Second, if you feel it's clear under the "gamestate" model, I'd love to hear how you would analyze the other examples (mine and Jay's). It's when breakdowns and errors occur that, in my opinion, the "truth" comes out and the real mechanisms of play are laid bare. Sure, when everything goes well and smoothly, it all seems like it makes sense. What about when it breaks down? Let's look at the problem cases. So far, I can't see how they can even be understood from the gamestate point of view.<br/><br/>For instance, when did that player write the note, and when did the nails "get poisoned"? What happens if I write, "I poisoned my nails yesterday, before the events of our last session" on a piece of paper? In that instance, "when" did the poison actually get applied to the nails?<br/><br/><small>AsIf's story is absolutely clear to me from a BCB Principle perspective (as is Jay's). I can explain how, if you like, though I'm a bit surprised that would be news to anyone. Do ask away if you think there's some kind of sticking point there and we can go through it!<br/><br/>I don't think any of the LARP examples are an issue, either, except maybe in the case of a LARP a person plays alone and doesn't tell anyone about - the theory does, admittedly, break down if there's only one participant. Not sure if that's a problem, though.</small><br/><br/>Third, that brings me to the "green dragon" and poor Sandra being frustrated at me. (Sorry, Sandra! I can't quite keep up with the pace of these discussions at the moment.) I'll try to summarize quickly in the next post...<br/><br/><small>(And I have no idea what that note about the hardholder is, Sandra!

The player with the poison apparently communicated his possession of the poison and how it was prepared with other players.  It entered into the SIS.  The NPC died that too was entered the SIS.  The other players had already been given knowledge of the note before game and that the PC had both the poison and applied it at the appropriate time was given credibility by the other players.  The LBCB Principle was still employed.  Aslf could accept the ruling of the DM pro-tem - LBCBP in action.  As a person Aslf could contest this and a big argument could break out and after hours of fighting decide that yes, he agrees that the statement "Your character is dead" is credible and thus it enters the SIS - LBCB Principle.  Aslf could refuse the outcome there is no consensus and the game grinds to a halt until a consensus is reached (the NPC is alive, dead, the provenance of the poison is shown to never have been run through the SIS [IOW the player of the poisoner cheated by putting poison on his sheet without seeking credibility], etc.) - LBCBP.   Whatever happened in this particular example does stem from actions occurring in SIS and the result was entered into the SIS.  <br/><br/>The real problem is as Jeff indicated - <i>the provenance of the poison</i>.  If the poisoner never passed the method through which he gained possession of a poison through the SIS then said player cheated WRT to standard gameplay theory.  Unless there was a Rule that allowed him to propose and allow himself full credibility without communication the Proposition that he possessed a poison ex-nihilo.  If the provenance of the poison was handled properly then Aslf is out of a beloved NPC.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485893/#Comment_485893" name="Item_638" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-12T23:17:51+00:00" title="June 12, 2019 11:17PM">June 12</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2019 11:19PM by Jeph.">edited June 12</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, it has nothing to do with the knowledge of the poison entering the SIS.

Helpful, sure.<br/><br/>I hear you explaining that mistakes can and do happen in any manner of play. Cool!<br/><br/>I hear you showing and explaining how you might go about correcting such mistakes. Great!<br/><br/>But none of that is what I was trying to get at. I want to know:<br/><br/>* Let's look at a failure case (a "mistake"), such as the ones I've suggested.<br/>* Let's assume that, in our example, it never gets corrected at all. Whether because the players don't notice, or because they decide it's not worth the trouble - it doesn't matter, as far as I can see.<br/>* How do we analyze/describe/understand what happened in such a failure case from the standpoint of this new theoretical framework?<br/><br/>That's what I want to see. I think it will be quite instructive.<br/><br/>I actually think that the "2d6 SWN example" could be our best bet - a really simple and easy one. I could talk about what's happening there from my perspective, if it would help. I do NOT understand how we can really think about that from a "gamestate" mindset without twisting ourselves into pretzels.<br/><br/>For instance, the "gamestate model" suggests that the vorpal sword is "real", whereas the "green dragon" is not. Do you feel that's an accurate representation of the hypothetical game I've described, where a bunch of adventurers go into a dungeon, never encounter any kind of vorpal sword, but do meet a green dragon that turns out to have been raised by the adventurer's father? Because that's not how I would look at this.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485896/#Comment_485896" name="Item_640" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-12T23:21:31+00:00" title="June 12, 2019 11:21PM">June 12</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Less relevantly, I can respond to Sandra's thought on the "utility" of what we're doing, because that's pretty cool.

I'm skeptical that we need this model to do that, though, and I have yet to see an example of an idea or rule or rules change which requires us to discard the BCB Principle in order to come into being. <br/><br/>Why do I need a "new model" to make rules about prepping material for my game? Even the very earliest versions of D&amp;D had rules for that. <br/><br/>If you replace "talking" with "interpersonal communication", in the last sentence I quoted above (which you really should), then we can start talking about what that might be. Are there things we do when play an RPG together that aren't about communicating with each other in order to construct an imaginary setting, sequence of events, and so forth? If we can identify some, that would be pretty cool. I think. (I don't claim to have thought this particular part through in any detail. :P )<br/><br/>What do I see as practical ideas, relevant to this discussion?<br/><br/>Here are some ideas to explore that I'm seeing here, which I like and want to explore more, but that don't (in my opinion) have anything to do with the BCB Principle or that whole theoretical understanding of games:<br/><br/>1. Let's talk about ways to do principled prep, and to handle information involved in our games that's not shared. Let's find new and cool and better techniques for the use of secret information at the table. <br/><br/>Awesome. 100% down. <br/><br/>2. Let's look at ways to communicate and to create, transform, or inject new information into our games that's not based on talking.<br/><br/>Also awesome! <br/><br/>(Although it seems to me this is only an issue because of the sloppy "Bog Model Wiki" text, which Sandra - understandably - took quite literally. I don't anyone who's given it more than two minutes of thought *actually* thinks that the only way we can communicate is by talking. So my disagreement here is with that Wiki entry - Sandra and I agree here, as far as I can see.)<br/><br/>3. Let's discuss the idea of a "game state", as an analogue or metaphor which has all kinds considerations in it aside from we're narrating in the moment: physical information tracking (notes, tokens, dice, electronic devices), details of fictional positioning, and the implications of the rules we've agreed upon (and how they limit our ability to imagine events together). (Maybe other things, too.)<br/><br/>Cool. Perhaps this will spark some ideas for new design, too. That would be awesome!<br/><br/>(Although I'm skeptical, because, as far as I can see, that's just the "old" way of looking at RPG play which existed and was explored pretty fully, in my opinion, in the 80s, 90s, and still is today, especially by many trad gamers and the OSR crowd.)<br/><br/>4. Let's find ways to make the fiction seem more real, concrete, and tangible.<br/><br/>Super!<br/><br/>I don't feel that any of these in any way invalidate the BCBP or whatever other theoretical ideas in any way. I feel 100% comfortable working with them from that point of view - there are no contradictions.<br/><br/><small>It's when we start talking about some kind of strange "real" thing which "exists" somewhere, when it - very clearly, to me - does not in any way, shape, or form, except perhaps in wishful imagination, that I start to worry. Aren't we conflating fantasy and reality if we do that?</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485897/#Comment_485897" name="Item_641" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-12T23:30:37+00:00" title="June 12, 2019 11:30PM">June 12</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's another thing to consider:<br/><br/>If we imagine that "content" gets "injected" into the gamestate in some fashion other than us communicating it to each other, how do we determine *when* that happens?<br/><br/>Let's take AsIf's story.

That point is unquestioned.<br/><br/>Less tangential was the fact that as set forth by me myself, we were both tactically noodling with our character sheets the night before the fight. The implication here being that whatever arrangements and tactical plans we made "off screen" were indeed real, as long as our characters didn't suddenly acquire something they hadn't already possessed. In other words, if any <i>transactions</i> were said to have occurred (ie: "I went to the poison store and bought poison for 300GP"), some other Player might have rightfully called foul. I would have also called foul since I was still the acting GM at that moment, and interaction with an NPC would have required my participation.<br/><br/>Of course, another interesting question is raised here: Is the GM still the GM even when the session has ended and nobody is at any table? But it's easy to answer Yes in this case, since this was <i>my</i> gameworld, and the day of the fight was the first and only time I ever handed over GM responsibilities for that world.<br/><br/>In my model at the time - I'm still not sure what to call it - there was no rule broken. I was unhappy and felt betrayed by the other Players (one of them might have warned me, for instance, though that would have opened yet another epistemological can of worms)... But I did not refute the acting GM's ruling, nor that the application of the poison had indeed occurred.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485912/#Comment_485912" name="Item_648" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-13T00:25:57+00:00" title="June 13, 2019 12:25AM">June 13</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What an awesome story.

One of the other Players spoke to me afterwards about it, saying that he wished there had been some way <i>in-game</i> to warn me, but there hadn't been. And I had to agree. In order for him to have warned me, he would have had to inject OOC information into his character (actual game-state data, not merely an idea), and we all knew that even with my fave NPC on the line, I wouldn't have agreed to the "reality" of that.<br/><br/>So we have the following things to ponder about:<br/>1. What is considered injectable from Player to PC? (answer in this case: No to "game-state data" but Yes to "mere ideas" - because how could you not?)<br/>and<br/>2. Who needs to know about changes in game-state? (answer in this case: at least one other Player, whether or not their PCs are aware of it.)<br/><br/>What I find interesting today is the fact that we all accepted the logic of the answers given above without even blinking. It's interesting because <i>that's how well-formed our shared understanding of the rules of the space was.</i>  The reason he needed to have shared the note with at least one other person prior to the beginning of the fight was to prevent me from being able to accuse him of having written it <i>during</i> the fight.

at things and what Sandra is doing are contradictory. They seem kind of orthogonal to me. Some things may be subsets or supersets of each other, or whatever, but there's really no fundamental disagreement with what came before here.<br/><br/>That orthogonality isn't trivial, though: Sandra's design efforts here are going in interesting directions. I <i>disagree</i> with Paul that she's just resurrecting the old "the rules are the physics of the world" model. There's at least the same level of self-awareness here as we see with any modern game text, for one thing, and a real understanding of semantics / linguistics / semiotics, for another. <br/><br/>Also, Sandra's 5E modifications seem to be mindful of the realistic limitations of humans, compared with, e.g., GURPS or Champions. (2097e doesn't have square roots, does it? ;-) ) That is, much of the design work is about making the game playable, without sacrificing important principles. (I think the amount of dedication and time that 2097e requires is a bit daunting, but that's fine. Making a blorb design that is nevertheless relatively low-stress to GM is probably an important future design horizon.)<br/><br/>I can also think of at least one really dramatic example from my own gaming past that can be meaningfully interpreted via either LBCBP or GameState. This was a failure, something that led to the complete collapse of a campaign. And it was basically my fault! <i>And</i> it involves blorb-related issues! I've been reluctant to share it because seriously, it makes me look like a total jerk. But it's just so relevant!<br/><br/>Post incoming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485924/#Comment_485924" name="Item_652" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-13T04:24:11+00:00" title="June 13, 2019  4:24AM">June 13</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooh, cool stories!

I don't think that's Sandra's position at all, nor do her design efforts seem based on that at all. However, there have been a few comments in this thread (mainly from others, I think, not Sandra) which were leaning heavily in that direction, and the whole idea of "a REAL gamestate that really exists" suggests something along those lines. I was reacting those in the moment when they were being made. I want to caution anyone who wants to go in that direction, so they can consider past debates and put some thought into how their model might need to be formulated so that it <i>doesn't</i> recreate that kind of old-school "rules as physics of the game world" concept.<br/><br/>I'm also trying to contribute some Actual Play content myself, on a related topic, over here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/22140/ap-prepping-for-dogs-in-the-vineyard-and-blorb-narrativism-and-game-state" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/22140/ap-prepping-for-dogs-in-the-vineyard-and-blorb-narrativism-and-game-state</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485925/#Comment_485925" name="Item_653" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-13T04:30:02+00:00" title="June 13, 2019  4:30AM">June 13</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, Burning Wheel. I join a campaign in progress. 4 pre-existing players; I am the 5th. Two of the other players are well-known to me, and are experienced GMs, but the actual GM is someone new to me. Still, the other guys seem to be having fun, and of course I love BW, so I jump in.<br/><br/>The campaign is this sort of weird fantasy post-apocalypse archipelago thing. The two guys who are experienced GMs also have characters that are powerful wizards; there's no way my incoming character could ever measure up. But, I find a way to carve out a niche for myself, or so I thought: given the constraints available to me, I managed to create a character who is both a doctor and a lawyer, and who has some scholarly skills to boot.<br/><br/>So I end up doing things like treating wounds and advocating for the group with important NPCs. Sometimes I succeed, sometimes I fail, but it's basically fine.<br/><br/>Then another player and I write a new Belief at the beginning of the session. They're worded differently, but both of us are interested in uncovering the true history of how the apocalypse came to this world. We read our new Beliefs out loud, and the GM doesn't object to them. (Cue ominous music.)<br/><br/>During the session, we get a chance to work on this Belief. We make a series of rolls: first a Circles test, to find the noble who has the historical records from the time of the Fall in his archives. Success. Second, a Persuasion check to get him to give us access to those records. Success. Third, a roll on my History skill (supported by my Research skill; combining skills like that is a thing you can do in BW\u2014people can try too hard and cheese it, but in this case it was super obviously relevant, or SO I THOUGHT [DUN DUN DUN]) to uncover the <b>real truth about the apocalypse</b>.<br/><br/>Record scratch. <br/><br/>The GM says, "No, you can't use History to establish that. You'd need [this very specific type of skill that I didn't have]" to do that. And I basically freak the fuck out. <br/><br/>Aside: The thing I didn't have was what's called a -Wise skill in BW. Like, if you have Forest-Wise, you can roll to "know" things about forests, but since BW GMs don't tend to prep very much, you're mostly using the skill to declare facts about the setting. Consequences for failed rolls can vary, but the GM can basically twist whatever it is you're trying to establish in some dramatically appropriate way. Now, my thinking was that, while History as a skill may not be usable to create facts <i>ex nihilo</i> the way Wises can, surely in context History was appropriate, especially given that I also had (and was using) Research: I was literally, in-game doing Historical Research. And the prior rolls had established that the information was <i>here</i>, in *this* archive.<br/><br/>But anyway, what ends up happening is that I bully the GM into letting me have my way. There's really no other word for it. I basically made every possible appeal to authority imaginable, complained, got a bit loud, etc. It was... not good.<br/><br/>So, I get to make my roll, I succeed, and now officially we know (and in fact I was able to make up) how the Apocalypse happened. But then we wrapped up the session and never played again.<br/><br/>Now, while I do feel bad about it, I've actually never been able to figure out exactly what would have been a better way to handle the situation. Since, even though I was the one who actually started arguing back, there was a pretty serious, and multifarious, failure on the GM's part here!<br/><br/>1) Failure to pay attention to characters' Beliefs\u2014remember, advocating for your characters' Beliefs is literally the entire point of play in BW.<br/>2) Failure to think through the consequences of the prior two rolls.<br/>3) Failure to think through what it meant to say "no" to someone rolling History combined with Research to... do historical research. (This is the part of the story I think is most salient to GameState theory!)<br/>4) Failure to properly blorb a reason for the apocalypse. (I just wanted to know what had happened, and for my character build decisions to matter, but I absolutely would not have cared if the GM had had hidden information rather than me needing to come up with the reason myself.)<br/><br/>As I said before, I believe this incident can be analyzed in terms of both theoretical models under consideration here. But I'm going to leave that to others as just posting about it was tough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485927/#Comment_485927" name="Item_654" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-13T04:35:32+00:00" title="June 13, 2019  4:35AM">June 13</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2019 4:45AM by Jeph.">edited June 13</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, I have no idea how you came formulate your beliefs about my stance.<br/><br/>They just seem so... entirely divorced from anything that I actually think or believe.<br/><br/>I really get Sandra's frustration with you.

You don't have to tell anyone else at the table when you do so. However, you do have to hold a purple cat's eye marble in the closed fist of your left hand."<br/><br/>And instead of revealing his note, TP had just opened his left hand to reveal a purple cat's eye marble.</p></div></blockquote>\nThat <i>showing of the marble</i> is the player's <i>act of communication</i> seeking to establish the proposition that his character "can secrete a contact poison" as credible.  That the eye references back to a textual rule in the book is an effort to boost his bid for credibility.<br/><br/>The hypothetical rule cannot force and enforce itself into the minds of the players.  They either agree to give the proposition credibility or they refuse it.  If at least one player calls BS then the one proposing (the poisoner) either has the option to either fight for it and try and convince the other players to give him credibility or the poisoner has accept that his proposition was not given credibility.  The poisoner can't force the players to accept his proposition nor can the dissenting player force the proposing player (the poisoner) to accept his refusal as the actual outcome.  All parties have to agree - or play stops while players argue over the Rules or someone votes with their feet and stomps off.  Nobody can be forced into accepting a proposition the don't want to.  Doesn't matter if the Textural Rules say this or that everyone has to agree.  It doesn't have to be overt as silent consent works just fine.<br/><br/>Credibility is oil by which the gears of the game turn.

It can't have a meaningful effect on play until you communicate that fact to others and it becomes a 2a.<br/><br/>2c. It's obviously possible for the DM to decide in their head that "if the character explore the Eastern Mountains, they'll find the module, <i>White Plume Mountain</i>, which I've never read". This has absolutely no effect on the game until the the PCs go to the Eastern Mountains, the DM opens <i>White Plume Mountain</i>, reads the parts of the module that the PCs are interacting with, and communicates those facts to the players, making it 2a.<br/><br/>I would also even argue 1b. and 1c. aren't meaningful, until they become 1a.

Either he or the interim DM should have suggested that you play out your NPC's days prior to the duel to give you that option, too (or to prepare a last will of whatever). The important thing is that you seem to have had different expectations ("Let's settle this with a single - implied: kinda isolated from the rest of the game - duel.").<br/><br/>Finally, using the other players for independet verification of his ploy was a no-go because it meant that you were socially isolated. Being the unwitting butt of a joke is not a very comfortable position to be in at the best of times, but we usually try to be good sports. But when a person you have issues with (e.g. a rival) is in on the joke, that's not cool at all. The other players should have shut this down when informed of the secret ploy because going along with it isolated you socially. Not cool.<br/><br/>So that's my take -- and it contains quite a few assumptions, so please correct me if I am wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485962/#Comment_485962" name="Item_670" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-13T15:27:58+00:00" title="June 13, 2019  3:27PM">June 13</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2019 3:29PM by Thanuir.">edited June 13</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Neurotrash" rel="nofollow">Neurotrash</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>2b.

Maybe I go for the scenarios where lockpicking seems more likely due to the skill.<br/><br/>(That there are unknown things also affects decision making, if we know of their presence, even if it their nature is unknown.)<br/><br/>The two more relevant factors are that things in the game state need not have any effect on gameplay, and that the set of people who knows a given fact is a function of time.<br/><br/>An example of something in game state not affecting gameplay, outside roleplaying for clarity: Consider a multiplayer strategy game with map exploration. None of the players happens to find the resources that were in a corner, simply because nobody happened to explore there. Yet the resources still were part of the game state, I would say. This can happen in most games of imperfect information. Or the "topmost card of my Magic deck" - a well-defined object in M:tG  that can be interacted with. It was part of the game state even if the deck was shuffled or the game ended before I had a chance to draw it.<br/><br/>The other matter is that "what is known" changes as the game is played. When preparing things, or making a character, I can not be certain which things will appear in play (in most roleplaying games). Yet, preparing things ahead of time gives me time to think and execute complicated processes, whereas doing things during play places heavy limits on how long the activity can take, to give an easy example. Hence, different kinds of rules mechanics are viable during preparation and during play. This certainly has game design implications.<br/><br/>Being under less pressure also leads to different decisions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485963/#Comment_485963" name="Item_671" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-13T15:30:56+00:00" title="June 13, 2019  3:30PM">June 13</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2019 3:33PM by 2097.">edited June 13</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Neurotrash" rel="nofollow">Neurotrash</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>It\u2019s obviously possible for the DM to decide in their head that \u201cif the character explore the Eastern Mountains, they\u2019ll find the module, <i>White Plume Mountain</i>, which I\u2019ve never read\u201d.

The game master probably thought of seeking that as a long term campaign goal and had not made a decision, binding or otherwise; that is to say, the nature of the apocalypse was not in the game state.<br/><br/>In Burning wheel, the game master is not supposed to have much secrets, but this does not mean they have to tell everything, so the game allows this kind of mismatch of expectations. Furthermore, the game is expected to contain both pre-defined content and improvised content.<br/><br/>The wise rules are pretty interesting in that, when used, they query the game state (has this been defined, i.e. are there statements about this in the game state or not) and then work differently based on the answer. (Or this is the common folklore; I just quickly checked BWG and did not find where it discusses wises and player authoring of facts. It was not in the relevant parts of the skills chapter, at least. Replace "wises" with "circles", if necessary.)<br/><br/>I am not sure there is much more to say, here, about the incident from the perspective of game state.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" title="Silmenume"><img alt="Silmenume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">Silmenume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485993/#Comment_485993" name="Item_679" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-13T22:20:37+00:00" title="June 13, 2019 10:20PM">June 13</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2019 11:55PM by Silmenume.">edited June 13</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello,<br/><br/>A little bg before addressing some questions.<br/><br/>The big tripping point in the early Threefold Model was that it rested on the internal states of the players - goals.  As a theory it might hold but it fails as a diagnostic model because self-disclosure of goals and actual observable behavior were very often at variance.  It wasn't particularly useful for game design as the designer had no reliable data to work with.  The other issue was defining what role-play actually was.  Each group defined role-play in terms of their own techniques.<br/><br/>The follow up theory was based on <i>observed</i> behaviors which made it much more useful as a diagnostic tool.  It also employed a description of play that allowed for all three modes of play while explaining how they were all a form of role-play.  Because it was focused on observable behaviors the model then defined play in the present progressive.  Role-play is not a state but an activity.  As this model of play was observation based it did not only look at Exploration but the interactions between the players on an interpersonal level during play. *hint - this is very important*  Play floats on a <i>Sea of Exploration</i> "where Narrativist and Gamist priorities ... are defined by an <i>interpersonal out-of-game agenda.</i>"  This "out-of-game" part implies the GameState idea that is currently being floated.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph">@Jeph</a> posted this upthread which I think is amazingly astute and extremely useful but got very little attention.\n<blockquote>In fact, there's absolutely nothing that appears in both the imagined reality and in the game state! They operate on different types of symbols.</blockquote>\nI couldn't agree more.  The SIS is not a subset of MIS, but rather they are two completely different spaces, that function in completely ways and are utterly dependent on each other.  I've been referring to the SIS as the "fact space" as I think it is conceptually useful.  What is being called the GameState encompasses everything in the SIS but encompasses everything up to and including the Social Contract level as well as Creative Agenda's.  This construct I am calling the "Concept Space".   This "Concept Space" is what I think about the facts of the SIS, where I individually store knowledge about our Characters, Situation and Setting, where I consider propositions that I might share in an effort to get it included into the fact space (SIS), the notion that Bob is arachnophobia so I won't use my shapeshifting spell to turn into a spider, where I consider whether I am enjoying what is going in play or not, etc.<br/><br/>The idea I'm trying to formulate is that the Concept Space is highly dynamic, ephemeral and subject to change all the time.  However as the structure is strictly Conceptual, supremely individualistic (definitionally) IOW that which is in our minds (that includes physical objects that having meaning to the individual but have not been used in an act of communication) while necessary to play is not sufficient unto itself and can do nothing to the fact space until communicated.<br/><br/>These two differently functioning and structured constructs cannot, cannot, cannot exist or function in isolation.  These two constructs are and must be in constant communication with each other.  One direction is passive and observational while the other is overt and highly ritualized.<br/><br/>I will also offer that while the GameState/Concept Space can act upon itself it cannot directly act upon the Fact Space/SIS.  The Concept Space can and does make itself relevant when a concept is formally and ritually communicated.  FREX I as the player can be made angry by something a player says outside the Fact Space (out of game) but this anger belongs to the realm of the Concept Space.  My anger does not affect the game unless I communicate my anger <i>it some way</i>.<br/><br/>Neither construct is more important than the other but neither can operate in isolation.  The GM prepping a game is not roleplay<i>ing</i>.  The GM is prepping.  A GM prepping a game is no more roleplaying that an actor memorizing lines is considered act<i>ing</i>.<br/><br/>Yes I think the GameState is vital to role-playing.  Without it the player has absolutely no game present in mind at all.  I don't disagree with the idea of a GameState at all.  I do take issue with the proposition that individual concepts by themselves never leaving the mind or being acted upon (like showing everyone the marble) have effect.  I think that is a category error.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph" rel="nofollow">Jeph</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph">@Jeph</a> -<br/>The point is, PT's character secretes the poison when he takes the marble in hand.<br/><br/>Not when he opens his hand and reveals the marble to the other players.</p></div></blockquote>\nActually no.  That fact has not been established.  Conceptually the individual player in their individual GameState may conceive it be so but that does not make it fact.  The GameState does not generate facts it only produces concepts.  To generate a fact the proposition must be communicated and given credibility to be treated as a fact thus entering the proposition into the fact space.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph" rel="nofollow">Jeph</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>BTW I think you'd have an awesome time studying Pragmatics in more depth, it seems to be something you're interested in and have a knack for.

There is one 'gamestate' per participant. <del>Functional</del> play happens where these intersect, i.e. in the SIS.<br/><br/>With this reasoning, the term 'gamestate' is a very poor choice of words as it implies some unified, objective existence. (At least the term 'real' has apparently been dropped as Sandra notes in another thread.)<br/><br/>[Edited June 19th to add: I have since stopped trying to redefine the term and have accepted it. I regret my harsh choice of words.]<br/><br/>Moreover, I think that it is not possible to a priori consent to future additions to the gamestate. Sure, I can promise that I'll grant absolute authority to the GM when it comes to, say, handling our grimdark fantasy setting, but that's a statement of intent, presumably by every participant. However, the agreement cannot be enforced once you introduce unicorns pooping rainbows, either because I just won't accept this and we both claim a breach of contract ("that's not grimdark fantasy" / "you must honor your promise") or because the unicorns wreck my suspension of disbelief to the point where I cannot really play anymore (I might try to humor you, but my buy-in is gone and my ability to feign interest may be limited).<br/><br/>(Like the error correction question, the example is indeed about the right - or even the ability - to add content.)<br/><br/>[Edited to cross out "functional" and remove confusing brackets around "never" and to note this was crossposted with Jay.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johann" title="Johann"><img alt="Johann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johann">Johann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485995/#Comment_485995" name="Item_681" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-13T22:36:04+00:00" title="June 13, 2019 10:36PM">June 13</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Having the PC drugged every night by a demon who did unspeakable things to him <b>isn't more OK just because it goes via the SIS</b>.

You can create lines or X-card or whatever to be part of the game state (just like prep is part of the game state) ior you can create safety tools that are on a completely separate layer from the game state.<br/><br/>Drug-demon can be such a contradiction if the prep says he does exist and some safety tool says he doesn't exist.

No one in the entire thread is currently in disagreement about that.<br/><br/>Calling the SIS the sacred \u201cfact space\u201d and the game state a mere \u201cconcept space\u201d is just an extremely provocative yet still utterly pointless renaming of terms.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Actually no.

But that doesn\u2019t change a single thing about the underlying workings of either model.

You changing that word to \u201cconcept\u201d and then applying the word \u201cfact\u201d to only a subset of those \u201cconcepts\u201d is meaningless when it comes to the semantic content of our model, you\u2019re only working on the lexeme level. I could say that things in the game state are \u201cbirds\u201d and things in the SIS are \u201cseagulls\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean that they will suddenly start eating fish.<br/><br/>I\u2019ve been pretty sloppy &amp; generous with what things are called; \u201cblorb / klockwerk / MIS / game state / offscreen canon / SIS / fiction / transcript\u201d I generally try to hold the prinicple that I\u2019m not married to any specific definition or usage of a particular word, as a way to avoid semantic swamps.<br/><br/>But these terms \u201cconcept space\u201d and \u201cfact space\u201d and this redefinition of \u201cconcepts\u201d and \u201cfacts\u201d do upset me.\n<ul><li>In some sense of the word \u201cfact\u201d, the Blackrazor is never ever factual since no one on actual Earth can hold it or see it.</li><li>In some sense of the word \u201cfact\u201d, the Blackrazor becomes factual when you plunk down <abbr title="White Plume Mountain">S2</abbr> on your campaign map</li><li>In some sense of the word \u201cfact\u201d, the Blackrazor becomes factual when it is communicated to at least <em>one</em> person (i.e.\xa0the DM reads that part of the module)</li><li>In some sense of the word \u201cfact\u201d, the Blackrazor becomes factual when it is communicated between at least <em>two</em> people i.e.\xa0enters the SIS</li><li>In some sense of the word \u201cfact\u201d, the Blackrazor becomes factual when it is communicated between <em>every single participant</em> which is what you were pushing for earlier, Jay.</li></ul>Tossing around these five completely incompatible usages of the word \u201cfact\u201d is only serving to drive our understandings further <em>apart</em> from one another, not closer.

But words <em>do</em> matter for how we want to design games since they have connotations &amp; provide affordances. In the game state model, we are obviously interested in that second event: plunking down S2 on your campaign map. To us that is an extremely fundamental predicate. You can call that \u201creal\u201d, \u201ca fact\u201d, \u201ca concept\u201d, \u201ca bird\u201d, \u201ca horse\u201d, \u201ca hot guy in jeans\u201d, \u201cfalse\u201d, \u201can unfact\u201d, \u201ca fish\u201d, \u201ca dream\u201d, whatever!<br/><br/>But if we want to get on the same page we need to respect each other\u2019s terms &amp; vocab. I\u2019ve yielded on the strict 4-sense definition of the word \u201cshared\u201d giving rise to the much clumsier construction \u201cMIS\u201d. I\u2019ve accepted that two actors don\u2019t \u201cshare\u201d a stage in your model and have adapted my use of terms to accommodate that.

There is one 'gamestate' per participant. <del>Functional</del> play happens where these intersect, i.e. in the SIS.<br/></div></blockquote>\nWell, that was an example of broken play.\n<blockquote><br/>With this reasoning, the term 'gamestate' is a very poor choice of words as it implies some unified, objective existence. (At least the term 'real' has apparently been dropped as Sandra notes in another thread.)<br/><br/>Moreover, I think that it is not possible to a priori consent to future additions to the gamestate. Sure, I can promise that I'll grant absolute authority to the GM when it comes to, say, handling our grimdark fantasy setting, but that's a statement of intent, presumably by every participant. However, the agreement cannot be enforced once you introduce unicorns pooping rainbows, either because I just won't accept this and we both claim a breach of contract ("that's not grimdark fantasy" / "you must honor your promise") or because the unicorns wreck my suspension of disbelief to the point where I cannot really play anymore (I might try to humor you, but my buy-in is gone and my ability to feign interest may be limited).<br/></blockquote>\nGamestate is (I think) defined as the set of true claims (or propositions or whatever) required to adjudicate the rules of the game. This definition does not work for freeform play, but does work for most other roleplaying and many other games; not really useful for games of physical skill, I think.<br/><br/>I am running a game. We are using a game which travel rules - the difficulty of a travel roll depends on the distance and the terrain, as well as how settled the area is. As soon as these things are determined, they become part of the game state. Thus, the rules for travel can be adjudicated. When they are not part of the game state, the rules can not yet be used.<br/><br/>As far as I see, you are discussion a different question of what kinds of input into the fiction is acceptable. It can be that the game master has added unicorns to their encounter table, used them to restock a dungeon, etc., and thereby added unicorns to the game state. If the players later object to the unicorns and the group comes to the conclusion of removing them, then the game state is changed accordingly. There is no problem here.<br/><br/>If you want a situation where the game state has split, you should consider either two separate groups playing in the same world, or maybe a group that has forgotten something and only later remembers it. This is a matter of error correction and has already been discussed several times.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>The concept also works with a more abstract ruleset; consider a game where players take turns to add a sentence to a story and it must not contradict the earlier contributions. Here, the game state includes the turn order and the previous contributions (I am ignoring safety issues and such for simplicity.): In order to continue play, we must consider what has been already said, and whose turn it is to contribute next.<br/><br/>In order to make a move in chess, one must know the position of the pieces, whose turn it is, and the details about castling and repeated moves. Who is playing black and who is playing white, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486017/#Comment_486017" name="Item_688" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-14T05:56:00+00:00" title="June 14, 2019  5:56AM">June 14</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Earlier, I said that what disturbed me about this line of thinking (although I'm getting less and less certain that I actually follow any of this conversation, frankly - it's starting to seem a lot like a "word salad" at this point, but maybe that's because I have no training in semiotics) - anyway, what disturbed me was this idea that we can categorize imaginary information as "facts" or "not facts", as "part of the gamestate" or not.<br/><br/>I mentioned that this seems to create some really bizarre and mind-twisting things to consider, whereas my understanding of the Big Model (which could be wrong, too!

You say "look, a pink elephant over there!", I accept your statement and imagine it, too, saying, "ooh!", and now we've created a SIS, which has a pink elephant. Credibility and assent.<br/><br/>In a group playing a roleplaying game, all the facts or statements that are given credibility by all the participants are part of the group's SIS, and that's what we use to play: that becomes our game's "board" and "pieces". <br/><br/>So, there are no "facts"; nothing is real or not real or part of the game state or not part of the game state - just bits of information that each of us knows or doesn't know and assents to or not. <br/><br/>Every time we start to establish something as "being fact" or "not being fact", it seems to me we're bound to head down an interminable rabbit hole of neverending confusion.

A game master adds a unicorn to the game world. It is now part of the game state, since it is available for use in resolving actions, for example casting the "locate unicorn" spell and tracking rolls to find horse tracks.\n<blockquote><br/>By comparison, as I understand it, in BCBP/SIS terms, this kind of thing is much easier to conceptualize.

It is useful to think about them when thinking about such issues.<br/><br/>Game state is the propositions you use to determine what happens or can happen next in the fiction, when you use Baker-Care-Boss system to do so.

It seems very complex and very prone to error.<br/><br/>"How many players have to communicate and be aware of a piece of information before it enters the gamestate?" That kind of thing is... painful. Oof.<br/><br/>In this model, don't we have to come up with *some* definition of when something "becomes fact", in order to use it? But how can you pick one of those five uses (above), or ever stick to it consistently?</div></blockquote>\nWell, the game state model nerds (or at least yours truly) have been using use 2 and Jay started using use 5 (and then maybe switched to use 4).<br/><br/>As Thanuir says, we also often try to avoid the word altogether because our usage of the word has been so upsetting to you but it's really impractical to do so consistently because <del>it's a fact that there is a Blackrazor over those mountains</del> see I almost did it again. It's similarly upsetting to <i>me</i> that there's no reciprocity around this whole vocabulary eggshell stepping you're having us do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_486023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486023/#Comment_486023" name="Item_691" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-14T06:52:42+00:00" title="June 14, 2019  6:52AM">June 14</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2019 6:53AM by 2097.">edited June 14</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You took the word "real", you took the word "shared", you tryna take the word "fact", you want to take all our words until we have to use words like "Blorb" or "Vank".
