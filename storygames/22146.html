This isn\u2019t as much a house rule as it is a variant in the DMG, but it\u2019s good to know up front that we play this way. There are no skill proficiencies (\u201cPerception\u201d etc). Instead, you choose two of your six abilities, for example Dex and Wis, and are proficient with all ability checks (such as foraging for food or grappling) with those two abilities. This is only for ability checks, and not for tools, saving throws, attacks etc, which all work as normal.<br/><br/>Be aware that Constitution and Charisma are not going to be rolled very often. Instead, if you want your character to say something, say it. If you want your character to look in a drawer, say that you look in a drawer. (There is one very specific situation where charisma checks are being made and that\u2019s during the downtime rules. \u201cI spend a week in this town trying to make friends\u201d \u201cOK, one week later\u2026\u201d. Maybe future house rules will add more opportunities for these checks.)<br/><br/>2. <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/character_sheets_1904.pdf" rel="nofollow">Character sheets</a> with both the above in mind, and also a special <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/inventory/" rel="nofollow">inventory sheet</a> on the back. The character sheet come with <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/5e-slot-grid/" rel="nofollow">slot grids</a> for caster classes so make sure to only print out the two pages (i.e.\xa0front &amp; back) you really need for your character.<br/><br/>3. Something you might want to have in mind when choosing spells:<br/><br/>Spells that targets an area of effect instead target a fixed number of enemies. For example, Burning Hands hits two enemies. (This is is less of an house rule and more of an optional rule from the DMG, I think it\u2019s page 249.)<br/><br/>Some spells, notably Light, Dancing Lights, and Goodberry, are now more expensive to use in terms of components.<br/><br/>4. A kind of weird take on hit points and defense rolls: <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/oh-injury" rel="nofollow">Oh, Injury!</a><br/><br/>There\u2019s also some other things but they don\u2019t really matter for character generation:<br/>5. I don\u2019t like using a lot of maps&amp;minis. You\u2019re standing <strong>in</strong> a room, not looking down on a room. But, I don\u2019t want to make that punishing for you either; if you want to say \u201cwe go to the room where we saw that bull statue\u201d, for example, that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not about making you get lost in the dungeon. That\u2019s what we have the wilderness for.<br/>6. A kind of weird take on targets, ranges and initiative: <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/introducing-late-night-fighting/" rel="nofollow">Introducing late night fighting</a><br/>7. More ways to get <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/inspiration" rel="nofollow">inspiration</a>. 8. The rules and consequences for climbing have been clarified. Thanks to Veins of the Earth. The thief\u2019s class ability \u201csecond story work\u201d has been expanded.<br/>9. The assassin\u2019s class ability to infiltrate in disguise has been clarified and buffed slightly.<br/><br/>Maybe more things that I forget now. I am an idiosyncratic DM.<br/><br/>Generally if you want to do things we\u2019ll find rules for it or make up rules for it. Sometimes very difficult and hopeless rules. We have clarified a bunch of the wilderness rules &amp; crafting rules.<br/><br/>Also optional rules from the books that we use:\n<ul><li>Cleaving (i.e.\xa0if you one-shot an <em>undamaged</em> enemy with a weapon attack, your damage can carry over to another enemy) from the DMG</li><li>The defense roll thing is from UA so it\u2019s not completely new either, I just fixed the math</li><li>Feats &amp; multiclassing</li><li>The detailed encumbrance rules from PHB p176, but with house ruled <a href="https///idiomdrottning.org/inventory" rel="nofollow">item slots of different sizes rather than pound weight</a>, as noted under \u201ccharacter sheets\u201d above.</li></ul>and <em>don\u2019t</em> use:\n<ul><li>We don\u2019t use point buy for stats. Instead, use standard array or roll 4d6-drop-the-lowest-arrange-in-any-order. PS have a witness if you choose to roll your stats, it\u2019s gonna be epic if you start racking up a bunch of eighteens.</li><li>We don\u2019t use flanking (the DMG optional rule, that is \u2014 the rogue still get their normal Sneak Attack) and a bunch of other stuff.</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
