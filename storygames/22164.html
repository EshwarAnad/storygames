I totally don't get why it's a thing. There are two possible formulations of MIS and neither of them make sense to me:<br/><br/><b>MIS-union:</b> Sandra says that MIS is the union of all PIS. That is, it's the superset of what everyone thinks the Game State is, or the superset of all PIS. If each player's PIS is a circle, and the circles overlap somewhat, then MIS-union is all three circles colored in.<br/><br/><b>MIS-intersection:</b> I mistakenly thought it was this, only the bits of the PIS that everyone shared in common. That is, if each player's PIS is a circle, and the circles overlap somewhat, then MIS-intersection is the small part in the middle that all circles have in common.<br/><br/>But neither seems useful at all to me.<br/><br/>One way to think of PIS is as a set of predicates, or statements, about the Game State. A predicate and be true or false. Each player's PIS contains statements that the player <i>believes</i> are true; there's no sense in a player holding a predicate in her head that she believes is false.<br/><br/>For example...<br/><br/>Adam might believe:<br/>A1. The current date in the world is 1489.<br/>A2. Waterdeep is a city in the world of Faerun, the Forgotten Realms.<br/>A3. Waterdeep is ruled by the Masked Lords and the Open Lord.<br/>A4. The Open Lord of Waterdeep is Dagult Neverember.<br/><br/>Bey might believe:<br/>B1. The current date in the world is 1489.<br/>B2. Waterdeep is a city in the world of Faerun, the Forgotten Realms.<br/>B3. Waterdeep is ruled by the Masked Lords and the Open Lord.<br/>B4. The Open Lord of Waterdeep is Laeral Silverhand.<br/><br/>Chen, the GM, might believe:<br/>C1. The current date in the world is 1488.<br/>C2. Waterdeep is a city in the world of Faerun, the Forgotten Realms.<br/>C3. Waterdeep is ruled by the Masked Lords and the Open Lord.<br/>C4. The Open Lord of Waterdeep is Laeral Silverhand.<br/><br/>The actual Game State (the Truth) is maybe something like:<br/>C1. The current date in the world is Hammer (January) 1, 1488.<br/>C2. Waterdeep is a city in the world of Faerun, the Forgotten Realms.<br/>C3. Waterdeep is ruled by the Masked Lords and the Open Lord.<br/>C4. The Open Lord of Waterdeep is Dagult Neverember.<br/><br/>Obviously, things like dates are pretty easy to get right, but somehow the GM thinks it's 1488. When Chen mentions the date, Adam and Bey are gonna go, "Huh? I thought it was 1489." Chen will probably check their notes and maybe the rules and some other stuff. This is because the date is set in the Game State, and the GM can consult the Game State using Techniques and get an answer, share that with the table, and everyone can come to an agreement about the date. Let's say the GM was wrong and it's really 1489, but it's January (Hammer) 1. Great.<br/><br/>What about the difference in the question of who the Open Lord is? In standard Forgotten Realms history canon, Neverember embezzled a bunch of money from Waterdeep and fled the city in 1489, so depending on the month, either might be Open Lord. Maybe this is after Silverhand has taken the role but Adam doesn't know it yet.<br/><br/>Okay, that's a lot of preamble, but I thought having an example might help.<br/><br/><b>SIS-union:</b><br/><br/>In this case, the union of all these predicates is: A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, B3, B4, C1, C2, C3, C4. These can be "collapsed" with a trick like this: AB1, C1, ABC2, ABC3, A4, BC4.<br/><br/><b>SIS-intersection:</b><br/><br/>In this case, the intersection of these predicates is only where everyone agrees, the "ABC" predicates: ABC2, ABC3. Obviously, an intersection is a useless tool for MIS, since it has nothing to say about the places where people conflict, so facts get entirely left out.<br/><br/>So I agree, let's totally discard SIS-intersection as a useless idea. <br/><br/><b>But what use is SIS-union?</b><br/><br/>It's actually not a subset of Game State, since C1 (The current date in the world is 1488) is wrong. BC4 is wrong. Those predicates do not belong to the G* set. <br/><br/><i>What purpose does it serve?</i><br/><br/>Hopefully this idea of thinking about PIS and Game State as a set of predicates is a useful addition. The predicates in the Game State are by definition <i>true</i>. The predicates in a player's PIS are <i>believed to be true</i>, but might not be. Even the GM's PIS is necessarily a subset (incomplete version) of the Game State. Even the GM's PIS can contain predicates which are false and are not members of the Game State.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_486752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486752/#Comment_486752" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-07-07T05:07:56+00:00" title="July  7, 2019  5:07AM">July 7</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as I understand, SIS is about the fiction, while game state includes the game mechanical state of the game.

While we could say "my imagination is simply flawed either due to lack of knowledge or due to forgetfulness", I think what's in my imagination is worth calling out as different.<br/><br/>Hm. Maybe it's a verb thing.<br/><br/>When I hear the phrase "imagined space" I think of a space which is imagined, and the imaginary house is not in fact actually imagined. So that's why I think "imagined space" != game state, because what's imagined is not the game state.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
