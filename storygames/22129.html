(I.e. the Forge definition of the SIS.) You create rules that inject entities into that set, alter entities in that set, or remove entities from that set. AW is set up that way. This leads to rules such as\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Apocalypse World 2nd" rel="nofollow">Apocalypse World 2nd</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Whenever there\u2019s a pause in the conversation and everyone looks to you to say something, choose one of these things and say it.</p></div></blockquote>All well and good as long as you only need to make rules that directly operate on that particular set.<br/><br/>However, when you want to regulate things that are more\u2026 offscreen\u2026 this design architecture starts to show its limitations. Your rules become indirect and multi-level. Threats in AW have their own list of moves operating directly on that primary data-structure and setting them up means creating new operands on that primary data-structure.<br/><br/>As a concrete example, here\u2019s AW2e on page 118 creating a new operand on the primary data-structure:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Apocalypse World 2nd" rel="nofollow">Apocalypse World 2nd</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>When you <strong>go into Dremmer\u2019s territory</strong>, roll+sharp. On a 10+, you can spot and avoid ambush. On a 7\u20139, you spot the ambush in time to prepare or flee. On a miss, you blunder into it.</p></div></blockquote>Instead of creating a territory and an ambush team and injecting it into an offscreen canon set of diegetical entities, in AW you set up &amp; prepare &amp; canonize a new rule that operates on the onscreen uttered set of diegetical entities, the SIS.<br/><br/>The threat map is a way to create and organize such rules; rules that are direct operands on the primary data-structure. The secondary data-structure in AW is the list of such rules. This includes the agenda, principles, moves for both MC and players, and also the custom moves created &amp; organized by the MC during prep. And by \u201ccreated\u201d, some are just selected from pp 107\u2013115 and then injected into the secondary data-structure.<br/><br/>I don\u2019t mean to be picking on AW. It\u2019s a very disciplined design, much more so than many PbtA games, which makes it an excellent and very clear example for the point I\u2019m making. I hope you see what I mean that almost every rule in AW is a direct operand on the primary data-structure, and the secondary data-structure is the list of such currently applicable rules.<br/><br/>In our model (blorb), we want to have rules that operate directly on the (much larger) data-structure of \u201cthe set of diegetical entities that are considered canon for this campaign\u201d so that\u2019s why we make <strong>that</strong> our primary data-structure instead.<br/><br/>An example of operating on that data structure would be\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>In Dremmer\u2019s territory there are three Scouts (Monster Manual p 349).</p></div></blockquote><em>(For those that are unfamiliar with D&amp;D: they have stealth +6 and multiattack with longbow.

I\u2019ll try to dig it up!<br/><br/>I know a handful of people in the OSR blogosphere who are working on or have published \u201cblorby\u201d rules for social interaction. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t find the link right now. I\u2019ll have to search for that later on, too, but it will take me a couple of days.<br/><br/>You might try applying the petitioner/granter technique and prepping a few petition and grants the NPC is prepared for or likely/unlikely to grant, as well as topics or points of leverage that are relevant to the NPC. That could help form a framework.<br/><br/>My general advice to people GMing in this style is to form an understanding of \u201chow something works\u201d. For instance, it\u2019s tempting for new GMs to design traps by saying, \u201cok! Here\u2019s a dangerous trap: if you do this it kills you, and by doing THAT you can disarm it.\u201d I find that often limits the GM when it comes to adjudicating anything other than those two approaches.<br/><br/>So, instead, I advise them to develop a basic understanding of how the trap functions, without committing to particular solutions. <br/><br/>Something similar for NPCs might work.

Burning wheel circles combines two things: The question of whether the NPC exists and whether they are found. In any traditional roleplaying game one can do the following: Consider the probability that such an NPC exists. GM rolls for it, if it is strictly between 0 and 1. If the roll misses by a little bit, the GM should take the strictest or the couple of strictest qualities into account and assume that an NPC with those is not found, but the others are there, or roll for which qualities are not present.<br/>Then the players get to roll to find the NPC using some social skill, etiquette, streetwise, charisma, ad hoc probability, etc. On success they find the NPC if they exist, and find the close equivalent the GM determined otherwise and know that whoever they are looking for does not exist. On failure, they do not find them, or maybe there is a breach of etiquette required to meet them, or the circumstances are awful, etc. This can be done in as principled a way as the GM usually does things.<br/><br/>2. When a new character is created, consider all of their characteristics. Add an NPC related to each. Distribute them randomly on the map (or proportional to population in cities or whatever), or as randomly as the nature of the NPC allows. Maybe make the NPCs as randomly as possible, given that they must be related to the characteristic.<br/><br/>3. Add a random encounter to the general tables: An NPC related to random characteristic of a random player character.<br/><br/>4. Whenever introducing an NPC that is not carefully defined in terms of personality etc., roll against a fixed probability for their personality to be relevant to the characteristics of some player character.<br/><br/>5. When prepping between sessions of updating the game world, roll a random characteristic from a random player character or from every one and add a related NPC close to where the characters are or to a random location.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Rolling a random NPC related to a characteristic: A characteristic can be about a living person (or undead, or whatever animate), a group of people, or something else.<br/>Examples of groups: Orcs killed my family and I hate them, the church is the source of all that is good and worthy, I am allergic to cats and fear and avoid them.<br/>Examples of things: I am the rightful heir to the throne, nobody else must learn about the entry into Dwimmermount, always be kind, I love listening to harp music, Serafina Caldwell is suspicious and up to no good.<br/><br/>If it is about a particular person, then they should be somewhere in the game world and also on the corresponding encounter and rumour tables, and the characteristic goes back to about being about something else.<br/>If the characteristic is about a group, than relevant NPC is a member of that group or has opinions about or ties to it. Roll one of the options.<br/>If the characteristic is about something else, than a relevant NPC is one who has opinions or ties, as above. Come up with a bunch of likely ones and roll a die to choose one. Maybe roll a die to determine if their opinion is positive, negative, or oblique.<br/><br/>After this use your default method of generating random NPCs.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The justification for creating precisely these NPCs is that there are lots of NPCs who have opinions about lots of things, but we are unlikely to pay attention to them unless they become relevant in play. Given a characteristic a player character has, NPCs related to that are more salient and less wallpapery. Therefore we should be more careful in determining who they are and what they do. <br/><br/>In practice this also increases the chances of meeting them - the shopkeeper you meet might very well have a cat, but that might go unnoticed and undetermined unless it is relevant (someone fears, loves or is allergic to them), in which case there should be some mechanism of making sure a sufficient number of cat owners are present in the setting.<br/><br/>It is too cumbersome to determine the relevancy of every NPC (given, say, at least four to five characters with four to five characteristics, so 20+ things to check; or make a digital generator with Abulafia or such), so maybe it is better to generate relevant NPCs a few at a time between sessions, or after character generation, etc.<br/><br/>Or maybe give, say, 1/6 chance that any NPC met is relevant to a random characteristic of someone, and then further 1/6 chance that it is relevant to another random characteristic, too, etc. until the roll fails. Roll for any NPC people interact, any NPC with a name, and any NPC in a charged situation. If there is a larger number of NPCs, assume 1/6 has a relevant characteristic and roll which those are.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The same method (whichever one chooses) could be used for distinguishing features of characters themselves - a reputation, an exotic species, a race with a particular social status, holy powers or magic where those are noteworthy or rare, a strange pet/familiar/robot servant, ioun stones flying around one's head, and so on.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I do not currently use any of the techniques mentioned above, so they are highly speculative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485625/#Comment_485625" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-08T18:26:31+00:00" title="June  8, 2019  6:26PM">June 8</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>How is \u201cinjecting a custom created NPC\u201d different from \u201cprepping a custom created trap/monster\u201d?</p></div></blockquote>They are the same in this regard.

A monster is something that can think or act somewhat independently. (Then there is green slime, shrieker mushrooms and piercers and nobody knows if they should count as traps or monsters. They are not exact categories.)<br/><br/>The definition does not say that a trap has to harm the player characters - indeed, they might notice it and use it for benefit, or maybe the trap only affects dwarfs and there are none among the adventurers, etc.<br/><br/>I think it is well-known at this point that monsters need not be hostile and treasures can be cursed or a double-edged sword, and so forth.<br/><br/>Thinking of them only in terms of their default functions leads to the kind of "invisible dungeon" school of design (see <a href="https://www.d20source.com/post/79192721174/the-invisible-dungeon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.d20source.com/post/79192721174/the-invisible-dungeon</a> ), which is useful if you want to build a railroad outside a dungeon or perhaps self-contained balanced encounters players can choose from, but probably not very useful for OSR-style design inside or outside a dungeon.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>I remember that once upon a time someone had written down a list of different types of bangs, or perhaps a list of ways in which a belief can be challenged, or something to that effect. If one was interested in having GM-independent input that is likely to create character drama, then maybe rolling from that list could work. It would not particularly respect the integrity of the fiction, though, so the GM would be responsible for that.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>One obvious thing to notice is that different characteristics are likely to come with different frequency in anything resembling a realistic world. Someone breaking gender- or other stereotypes would probably hear about it often (assuming this has been accepted as part of play), while someone who wants to stop an obscure conspiracy would only rarely meet anyone who knows about it or is affected by it.<br/><br/>One answer might be that if you want drama about the obscure conspiracy, go and make it. It is not like your D&amp;D ranger who hates hippogrifs will have more of those attacking from the skies; you need to take initiative and find them. Why should this be any different for dramatic issues?<br/><br/>And to this one might answer that an alcoholic is better off not being in situations where drinks are available. But then, so are D&amp;D characters better off when not delving into ancient deathtraps. Still they go into those, due to various justifications of their players, or without any. Revisiting some discussions about turtling might be in order.<br/><br/>So maybe the characters should be of the type that naturally seek or get involved in dramatic situations? And if they no longer do, then they retire, just like in D&amp;D. The concept of "kicker" in Sorcerer does not seem unrelated.<br/><br/>I am not going to draw any conclusions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485672/#Comment_485672" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-10T06:54:50+00:00" title="June 10, 2019  6:54AM">6:54AM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" rel="nofollow">Thanuir</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>It is not like your D&amp;D ranger who hates hippogrifs will have more of those attacking from the skies</p></div></blockquote>\nBut in Burning Wheel, that's exactly what <i>is</i> going on.

This does not always mean "rule of cool" or whatever, but it does mean that time moves faster over boring bits, coincidences that could happen do happen more often that you'd expect, and so on. PCs meet Abraxas all of a 10% of the time when hanging in its territory, where NPC farmers only meet it 0.1% of the time.<br/><br/>All the rules about regulating e.g. random encounters are as much about allowing the cool stuff to occur (to legitimize that the GM is not just arbitrarily feeding us to Abraxias) as they are about encouraging it to occur; they replace a GM's subjective sense of pacing and drama with an arbitrary system. We often call this a strive towards "realism", but what we actually mean is a sort of enhanced yet arbitrary reality in tension between adventure drama and real concerns.</p></div></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485679/#Comment_485679" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-10T09:20:23+00:00" title="June 10, 2019  9:20AM">9:20AM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is some degree of incompability with that attitude and the sort of "They came to the dungeon.

Once you\u2019ve established what your prep does, you can find these principles and apply them to less familiar areas. <br/><br/>For instance, let\u2019s take your definition of a trap is \u201ca thing that, under certain circumstances, does a typically harmful thing.\u201d<br/><br/>Let\u2019s apply this to my example of Jim the Barkeep: <br/><br/>Jim\u2019s wife is a spy for the Conspiracy. Jim thinks the Conspiracy is interested in anything to do with magic and historical secrets. Therefore, anytime someone mentions something related to magic or historical secrets at his bar [\u201cunder certain circumstances\u201d], Jim relays the information to his wife, who delivers it to the Conspiracy [\u201ca typically harmful thing\u201d].<br/><br/>This is great, because it determines a mechanism but not what will happen or when. Anyone who figures out how the mechanism works can find ways to use it to their advantage: feeding misleading information to the Conspiracy, for instance, or putting a tracking device on Jim or his wife to find out where the Conspiracy contacts are hiding. <br/><br/>That\u2019s good stuff.<br/><br/>More importantly, though - and this is what my question was all about - HOW do you decide when to place a trap in a dungeon? What\u2019s the criteria for that?<br/><br/>If you can nail that down, you can start to use the same criteria for placing \u201ctraps\u201d in other contexts, whether that\u2019s cursed treasure, dangerous people in a relationship map, the distribution of hexes with dangerous encounters on a map, or whatever else. <br/><br/>For example, maybe your answer is \u201cI never place traps myself, because I know my players too well. I use pre-written modules with traps in them, or I place them randomly, room by room, when that can\u2019t be done.\u201d<br/><br/>Applying that logic (\u201csomeone else places the traps, or i randomize them room by room\u201d) to your urban relationship map might mean \u201cI hand off my relationship map to a friend who knows nothing about the PCs and ask him<br/>to define which ones are \u2018dangerous\u2019\u201d or \u201cI list 1d6 possible \u2018traps\u2019 and then use a die roll, checking each person on the relationship map, to see who\u2019s dangerous.\u201d<br/><br/>It\u2019s a brainstorming tool to develop new techniques for prep. The stronger the principles you start with, the better the results.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485701/#Comment_485701" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-10T17:04:21+00:00" title="June 10, 2019  5:04PM">5:04PM</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2019 5:10PM by Paul_T.">edited 5:10PM</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>In which case my answer, that (according to Paper\u2192Rock) injecting traps can <em>never ever</em> be custom-tailored to a PC but instead needs to be done <em>without</em> any knowledge about the PC, <em>is</em> a relevant answer, isn\u2019t it?<br/><br/>I\u2019m realizing that the core idea is disclaiming decision making<br/><br/>(These tables still are going to have to be created between sessions, ideally at character creation time, because of the \u201ctwo hats\u201d-principle [don\u2019t be a game runner and a game prepper/creator at the same time].)<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nYes! This is great.

So we basically mandate for the GM to prep things which interact with the PCs\u2019 Issues.<br/><br/>It\u2019s analogous to how, in a D&amp;D context, we mandate that prep has to do with things like Porte-monstre-tresor - those are the salient interactive \u201cbits\u201d we come to play out and what D&amp;D\u2019s character generation rules and resolution techniques are all about.<br/><br/>No amount of porte-monstre-Tresor will get us a satisfying game about how a young person can struggle with the reality of deciding whether to care for an unwanted child.<br/><br/>No amount of focused, player-authored, Premise-addressing Bangs will give us exciting and impartially adjudicated trap searching, combat, and exploration.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite" title="AlexanderWhite"><img alt="AlexanderWhite" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite">AlexanderWhite</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485703/#Comment_485703" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-10T17:25:41+00:00" title="June 10, 2019  5:25PM">5:25PM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Out of interest, would the following mechanics be legit or lame?<br/><br/>Lets say at character creation, when you choose or roll a value/ethos, they have mechanics attached.
