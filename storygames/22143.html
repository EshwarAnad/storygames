You start wanting to discuss safety tools to improve them and people are like \u201cWtf, are you against safety?!\u201d and I\u2019m like no, but\u2026 if they don\u2019t work\u2026 There\u2019s this cargo cult approach to safety tools where people never ever question them and we end up with a large katamari of safety tools that \u201care all, of course, in use at our table, because we Care About Safety\u2122\u201d<br/><br/>Well, I care about safety, too.

I would rather have safety tools work on a completely different level; like how a horror movie has the volume knob &amp; offswitch on your TV on a separate layer from the aesthetic choices made by the writer, director and editor. <strong>I have this sorted as a minor gripe because a coherent ruleset is not nearly as important as our safety.</strong>)</small>\n<h2 id="lines-veils">Lines &amp; Veils</h2><h3 id="lines">Lines</h3>In a one shot or con game, lines are risky because you run in to the \u201cdon\u2019t think about strawberries\u201d effect where some people just start thinking <em>more</em> about strawberries.<br/><br/>Lines are good in a long campaign because over time people can internalize where the line goes. In our home game running since 2014 we do use them. Also we have a DM (yours truly) that can try to enforce them.<br/><br/>Someone proposed a work around is to make a <em>very</em> general line; like \u201cthis game is PG-13\u201d or whatever, <em>but</em> that requires a specific understanding of the ratings system that many people might not have. Or \u201cthis is suitable for polite company\u201d or whatever but again that\u2019s gonna be flawed. But it\u2019s better than nothing\u2026?<br/><br/><b>Update:</b> I wasn't clear that lines can override prep, if they contradict.\n<h3 id="veils">Veils</h3>The natural tendency of people to elide detail can be good sometimes (and bad sometimes); I don\u2019t see a reason to fight human nature on that point.<br/><br/><strong>Actively</strong> veiling, like \u201clet\u2019s draw a veil on that\u201d or \u201clet\u2019s fade to black on that\u201d has a couple of minor cons.\n<ol><li>It can remove agency&amp;consent if it\u2019s not clear what a character in the veil actually consented to or actually did.</li><li>It can have a variant of the invalidating, patronizing \u201cdon\u2019t you worry about that honey\u201d effect (point 4 under X-card above) on someone who is being hurt by the content</li><li>It can make things shameful that aren\u2019t meant to be shameful [uh, what that is, I\u2019m unclear about since I\u2019m so out of the loop with the mores of general society]</li><li>It can sometimes not do a lot. Like the offscreen act of violence in the movie <em>Reservoir Dogs</em> is still gruesome because of the power of imagination. Which is what we\u2019ve already geared into superdrive by sitting at a table.</li></ol>If you\u2019re careful about navigating these four cons, you might think active veiling is worth it. I tend to not use active veiling. If we don\u2019t want a particular piece of content in the game, we don\u2019t want it at all. I\u2019d rather use a line.

I was a player in this robot larp and we did workshopping for a super complicated safety tool system with multiple colors and dimensions and my partner [in the larp] and I had a hard time getting it so I asked for us to keep trying the workshop exercises until we had internalized it fully which we eventually did [temporarily\u2014I had forgotten it the next day]. And then near the end the facilitators said that if something happened beyond that, we were also free to break the game &amp; come talk to them.<br/><br/>And you know what? We ran into a completely game breaking issue <em>right away</em>, my partner and I. It was something that the multi-variant color-coded complicated system couldn\u2019t solve (because it was something specific that he <em>did</em> need to happen in order to feel safe rather that something he <em>didn\u2019t</em> need) but breaking the game, talking to the facilitator, sorting it out, and getting back into it with the <em>specific</em> advice in mind turned that session into an awesome &amp; memorable game.<br/><br/>Talking to each other with real language \u2192 much better.<br/><br/><i>[continued, this is a double length post]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486005/#Comment_486005" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-14T03:15:03+00:00" title="June 14, 2019  3:15AM">June 14</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<h2 id="luxton-technique">Luxton technique</h2><a href="http://briebeau.com/thoughty/2019/03/the-luxton-technique-by-p-h-lee/" rel="nofollow">This is from a post by P.

We learned pages after pages of mnemonics on various and different techniques to use to get away from the problem, to not have to face it. And then in the second year, we <strong>gradually</strong> started using those techniques less and less, as we spend more and more time just sitting with the problem &amp; being with it &amp; working on accepting &amp; improving our relationship with it.<br/><br/>Most people, if they are sensitive (like I was; yes, I get that not everyone is), are in the \u201czeroeth year\u201d, metaphorically speaking. <strong>Tossing them into the deep end of second year stuff is like asking someone with a freshly broken leg to start running right away</strong> because some misguided notion of \u201cexcercise is healing\u201d. Yes, physical therapy is going to be part of recovery for you and you leg but uh, you can also fuck things up if you\u2019re not ready for it.<br/><br/>Yes,\n<ol><li><em>sometimes</em> you luck in to a role playing game session being very healing. And that is fantastic! Just don\u2019t rely on it.</li><li>I do agree with Lee about all the ways the current (X-card, veils and the like) approach is \u201canti-healing\u201d / dangerous / invalidating</li></ol><h2 id="i-will-not-abandon-you">\u201cI will not abandon you\u201d</h2>This is something, from <a href="http://fairgame-rpgs.com/index.php/fairgame/thread/32" rel="nofollow">an Meguey Baker post</a> that I thought was (thankfully) dead and buried but then Ron brought it up again at LinCon.<br/><br/>It\u2019s the idea that trying to avoid hurting each other is the equivalent of \u201cabandoning\u201d each other.<br/><br/>It pressures people into not being aware of their own boundaries.<br/><br/>This is horrible.<br/><br/>I try to take a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postel%27s_law" rel="nofollow">Postel\u2019s Law</a> take on it though, now that I\u2019ve become a little bit stronger after therapy.

You can\u2019t just boss people around using the Sacred Language of Safety Tools or whatever <em>if it hurts them</em>. Sometimes you have conflicting needs that you have to talk out amongst each other (or even break up the group over it).

We (my old 00s group) used to start every session with \u201csee you on the other side\u201d and then speak completely in character throughout the entire session. Promising to see each other through.

I don't have a great deal of personal experience with these things, because I haven't ever encountered anything really, truly upsetting to me in an RPG (but I also am quite discriminating about what I play and with whom), and I'm usually very willing to talk about it, adjust, and so forth. As a result, I'm not sure I've ever seen a "line crossed" in a significant way with a group, which makes me not much of an authority or an expert, as far as I'm concerned. (There was one close call in my recent play history, but the group in question handled it really well by making sure everyone was on the same page, and we got through it quite admirably, just by being self-aware, polite human beings. I am very well aware that this was a rare "positive" case, and things could have been far worse, of course.)<br/><br/>I love reading about these issues and learning more about them, so we can all learn to do better. As a result, I want to thank Sandra for starting this thread and for all the careful thought and analysis she is giving the topic.<br/><br/>My personal experience has been that Lines &amp; Veils (as a preventative measure) have never seemed to be very useful, but having the concept available to the group is a nice thing - at least we can share the idea that <i>this is something we can do for each other</i>, which is already a good starting point.<br/><br/>My favourite tools so far have been discrete, positive signals at the table. I used the Support Flower (<a href="https://dtwelves.com/gaming/safety-calibration-cards/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://dtwelves.com/gaming/safety-calibration-cards/</a>) at a convention, and it really added to the game. I'm not sure I find it very practical (it's a lot to look at and hard to read when someone puts their hand on it!), but with a group that was into using it together, it was wonderful.<br/><br/>My own idea was to recreate just a handful of the prompts on the Flower with hand signals that are easy to remember, but I haven't tried that technique just yet.<br/><br/>Here is a list of some support ideas and tools I found while looking for the Support Flower:<br/><br/><a href="https://dtwelves.com/gaming/safety-calibration-cards/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://dtwelves.com/gaming/safety-calibration-cards/</a><br/><br/>I want to venture a guess that "safety tools" and "support tools" become more and more important the less a group uses "out of game" communication at the table. People who are into hardcore immersive play, "anything you say, your character says," heavy GM direction, LARPing, and similar might need such tools the most. In a gaming style where everyone is constantly making commentary and asking each other questions, I wonder if the tools might be much less needed, because that constant flow of communication lessens the danger of the game going awry.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486021/#Comment_486021" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-14T06:41:50+00:00" title="June 14, 2019  6:41AM">June 14</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2019 6:42AM by 2097.">edited June 14</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Johann">@Johann</a>: Oh, don\u2019t worry that personally I was triggered by you mentioning the demon <i>as an examle</i>; I was just saying that it would\u2019ve been just as unsafe in either model; I mean that the \u201cNo. That is <em>not</em> happening\u201d is equally effective or <em>un</em>-effective in either model.<br/><br/><b>Support Flower</b> I was familiar with, that and a <b>ton</b> of similar system.

I\u2019m not even sure if we used any others!<br/><br/>It was REALLY helpful. I can try to explain why. <br/><br/>The game we were playing was intense and personal - tragedy, horror, characters at each others\u2019 throats, issues of (fantasy) racism and horrible atrocities, etc. We were basically strangers, so it was slightly nerve-wracking.<br/><br/>When people would put a finger on the \u201cshow enthusiasm/appreciation\u201d part of the flower, it gave us all confidence in moving forward. We could revel in the horror or the drama or whatever while a simple physical sign would still communicate \u201cyes, I\u2019m into this!\u201d<br/><br/>(Without getting too graphic, there\u2019s a parallel here to clear and ongoing consent in sexual relationships.)<br/><br/>When that dynamic wasn\u2019t happening (maybe a scene is in progress and no one is \u201cshowing enthusiasm\u201d), it meant that we knew to tread carefully and check in with each other, because there was the potential for a problem.<br/><br/>It just felt REALLY good.<br/><br/>tl;dr - safety tools that allow us to Break or Veil or stop things are great and important. But techniques which allow us to show appreciation, enthusiasm, and enjoyment are also really powerful. Because no one has to \u201cremember\u201d to use them when they\u2019re scared or frozen or concerned - they, instead, signal a potential problem <i>by their absence</i>, which is, in a way, pretty \u201cfoolproof\u201d (it doesn\u2019t require people to remember any techniques or training or special tools - it happens automatically when play breaks down in any way).<br/><br/>As an aside:<br/><br/>I agree that the physical limitations of the flower are a big problem. We were only four and we still needed two on the table just so we could reach. And reading the tiny text across the table was even more challenging (especially if someone is covering it with their hand!). That\u2019s why I would ultimately consider hand signals or something similar, instead. That you can do in almost any situation (except if you\u2019re not looking at each other. I suppose!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486038/#Comment_486038" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-14T14:11:33+00:00" title="June 14, 2019  2:11PM">June 14</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, gestures, that's what we have; hand held over head means "OOC talk". could be rules questions could be safety questions. not every OOC statement is accompanied by hand-over-head but it's great when you want to make it REALLY clear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_486039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486039/#Comment_486039" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-14T14:16:34+00:00" title="June 14, 2019  2:16PM">June 14</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2019 2:17PM by Thanuir.">edited June 14</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have had one strong and unwanted experience in a game.

For example, I probably couldn't do most / many hand signals. *shrug*<br/><br/>While I don't disagree with the critiques of, for example, the X-Card or Script Change or whatever, it's also important to see the forest for the trees here. Simply giving any thought to these things <i>at all</i> is a huge step forward. (I'm not arguing against continued improvement, of course.) My hands' situation aside, the thing that's most often been problematic for me in games is simply abusive GM authority. Sure, players can be abusive dicks, too, but the usual GM setup makes it much more likely to come from the GM.<br/><br/>So anything that reduces GMs' unbridled authority, and says that there is something else more important, is good.<br/><br/>Now, for someone who (understandably) doesn't like the X-Card, hearing that cons are starting to require them on every table might be really off-putting, and understandably so. While we should work with con organizers so that they can offer a wider menu of safety options, consider that the way things worked before was that GMs were literally not given any actual reasons to consider the safety of the participants in their games.<br/><br/>And when GMs start thinking about safety, sometimes\u2014not always\u2014they also start thinking of themselves as being bound by rules in other ways, too. Which is really the thing I most want and need for my personal gaming experience to get better.<br/><br/>But, yes: GMs need to find ways to use safety tools that are in line with each game they're running. I use X-Card sometimes, but have done other things at other times. When I ran Ron Edwards's Circle of Hands, for instance, we just had a brief pre-game talk about what the game was like, what sorts of content we did / didn't want to see, and I specifically talked about why the X-Card was <i>not</i> an appropriate tool for that game.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486105/#Comment_486105" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-15T02:37:10+00:00" title="June 15, 2019  2:37AM">June 15</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_486111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486111/#Comment_486111" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-15T05:05:03+00:00" title="June 15, 2019  5:05AM">June 15</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<small>Matt, you're right that propping up gestures as a universal solution was ableist &amp; shortsighted.

What is the ratio of that to Jeepform and similar?<br/><br/>The reason I ask is because, from my perspective, there are two totally separate strands at work in the stateside scene. On the one hand, you have indie gamers, who are heavily influenced by the Scandinavians, Jeepform, Knutepunkt, etc. and are, as you say, mostly on the same page: you have a lot of players who really want to "go wild" with the extremely dark content, but at the same time do genuinely at least try to make safety a thing, if often clumsily as you point out, Sandra. They're the folks who I think stand to gain the most from your commentary.<br/><br/>On the other hand, while I'm open to arguments the other way, completely un-self-aware D&amp;D GMs (and entire D&amp;D groups, to be fair) have been and continue to be the source of <i>so much shitty and abusive behavior</i> that it just seems like it has to be better to try to do <i>something</i> about them, rather than nothing. And since that's, like, 99% of the American tabletop scene...<br/><br/>OTOH, if 99% of the Nordic tabletop scene is also completely un-self-aware D&amp;D (or local equivalent), then forget I said anything. <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486262/#Comment_486262" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-17T06:24:37+00:00" title="June 17, 2019  6:24AM">June 17</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're right that there's a heavy indie/jeep scene here and that I def have them in mind.

Such as it is\u2026 I feel like I'm maybe 20% of the way to good safety, if that. It's patronizing to see them as "us, but five years ago" or w/e and I don't think it's accurate either. The cargo cult approach to safety that dominates e.g. the Gauntlet, we're starting to see some of that in D&amp;D space too.

The examples you've discussed are exactly where the X card works best. If there is a prison scene and you use the X card, players may guess you have some problem with prisons. Could have been also a prison movie that you've just watched - who knows? Nothing needs to be discussed.<br/>(if discussing/opening up may be healthier for you is another matter...)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_486350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486350/#Comment_486350" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-17T23:03:21+00:00" title="June 17, 2019 11:03PM">June 17</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I understand what Sandra's saying.

As a result, many aggressively championed it, because the alternative was "no safety tool" and the prevalence of hurtful gaming seemed to show that an approach with no safety tools wasn't, empirically, working. It should also be noted that the use of safety tools in American convention RPG play remains minimal. Usually it isn't discussed. Thus, to the overwhelming majority of American RPG players, the concept of a safety tool remains a mindblowing innovation, something people have never HEARD of before, JD! Wow! The X-Card's one of the easier ones to explain, which makes it very attractive for convention play.<br/><br/>I don't typically use the X-Card in my play because I have enough experience and can grab onto enough authority at the table to steer things down the middle of the road. This isn't a brag and I'm not perfect but the X-Card wouldn't add to my toolbox significantly in most games. However, there is one game where I use the X-Card every time, which is Tall Pines, a game which always begins the same way: with the nonaccidental death of a beloved teenager.  Because the game can get into extremely heavy, traumatic zones almost instantly, I don't have enough time to get a read for the table and know when things are going awry. (Even in Tall Pines, you could throw away the X-Card after Act I and it would be fine.) <br/><br/>The X-Card, and all safety tools, should be deployed to supplement the abilities of the humans at the table; not every human at every table in every circumstance will benefit from the same set of tools, so it should not shock us when someone says "The X-Card is no good, it doesn't do anything for me." and someone else says "Without the X-Card I would have been in so many more disastrous situations; with it, I was able to steer my way out of them."                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_486468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486468/#Comment_486468" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-20T19:41:57+00:00" title="June 20, 2019  7:41PM">June 20</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kinda seems like folx not reading the OP?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486469/#Comment_486469" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-20T19:43:56+00:00" title="June 20, 2019  7:43PM">June 20</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Me" rel="nofollow">Me</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>It\u2019s not enough\u2014sometimes you don\u2019t dare to X-card something because you don\u2019t want to reveal that your brother\u2019s in prison or whatever</p></div></blockquote>\nDorx: "everyone always dare to X-card"\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Me" rel="nofollow">Me</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>X-card\u2013pretending it never happened is only going to invalidate those who\u2019ve been harmed, not magically heal them up</p></div></blockquote>\nDorx: "x-card is such a great way to unsay things, it's a miracle"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
