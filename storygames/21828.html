Most of them came from strange corners of my mind and that's why you can play a tree, a robonimal, a constellation, a pensioner or a cuddly toy... Or more conventional stuff like time travelers and Victorian explorers. System-wise, it ranges from your average d6-based game to diceless and GMless to games where you use Mikado sticks or a derivative of Rock/Paper/Scissors. Oh, and they're all between 1 and 5 pages long.<br/><br/>I originally wrote them in French but I decided to retype them for the English version; you'll find both in the PDF so you can have a taste of how it looked like before translation.<br/><br/>Oh, and you can get the collection for any price you want, <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/254803/A-year-of-miniRPGs-season-one" rel="nofollow">right there</a>; getting it for free is perfectly alright by me!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477418/#Comment_477418" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-02T04:30:11+00:00" title="November  2, 2018  4:30AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a brave and excellent project to pursue. Nicely done!<br/><br/>I haven't looked at the games themselves, but I'd love to hear more about what the process was like for you.<br/><br/>What was hardest about it?<br/><br/>What did you learn in the process?<br/><br/>What about the games you created surprised you?<br/><br/>Would you recommend this "challenge" to another person? If so, would you modify it in any way first?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477876/#Comment_477876" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-17T18:33:28+00:00" title="November 17, 2018  6:33PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Noted and promoted!<br/><a href="http://fictioneers.net/games/year-mini-rpgs-season-one" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://fictioneers.net/games/year-mini-rpgs-season-one</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
