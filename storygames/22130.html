PCs are meant to rise and rank and become the active factions.<br/><br/>3) Closer to 20+ players in various combinations on various days ( West Marches style).<br/><br/>4) Characters not necessarily assumed to be friends, but PvP element more about the race to name level and conflicts then, rather than direct, below-name-level, shankings.<br/><br/>Just curious. Would love to hear about how things turned out.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485651/#Comment_485651" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-09T13:08:11+00:00" title="June  9, 2019  1:08PM">June 9</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/2167/what-was-braunstein-and-why-was-it-important-to-the-beginning-of-the-hobby" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/2167/what-was-braunstein-and-why-was-it-important-to-the-beginning-of-the-hobby</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485652/#Comment_485652" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-09T13:24:26+00:00" title="June  9, 2019  1:24PM">June 9</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2019 1:30PM by 2097.">edited June 9</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The guy who made Braunstein is here on Story Games, so yes!<br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/search?Search=braunstein" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/search?Search=braunstein</a><br/>Edit: he never posted anything. wow<br/>But isn't the west marches sort of this too?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485654/#Comment_485654" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-09T13:41:21+00:00" title="June  9, 2019  1:41PM">June 9</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think West Marches has the same goal. <br/><br/>In WM, it seems more like bands of adventurers with no end goal of becoming landed powers in setting, and largely are non-hostile to one another anyway.<br/><br/><br/>I also don't know if WM can be mined out.

The main difference is that I have rarely had ten regular players, not to speak of twenty - that's big city numbers, outside the occasional special session. The second difference is one of degree: I don't consider it a qualitative difference, but generally like 90%+ of our play has been more PvE than PvP.<br/><br/>Our latest campaign arc from a couple of years ago (the medieval Sweden one) evolved into this sort of thing in miniature: the two main adventuring parties in the campaign had incompatible ideologies and goals. They also had largely overlapping players, but different players took the leadership initiative in both parties, and we play rather hard, so the questions of trust and diplomacy were quite real. The main conflict was "amoral wizard" vs. "Christian paladin" pretty much, so classic D&amp;D connivance in that regard.<br/><br/>But yeah, Bob's list of requirements doesn't seem beyond the pale to me. Given the right circumstances (mainly, more players) that'd describe our play pretty well. I particularly think that it's a good idea to let the players have primary control and responsibility over strategic goal-setting, and that tends to naturally lead to strategic PvP of various degrees over time. From my perspective the static adventuring crew is a somewhat artificial conceit that needs to be actively maintained; sandbox play will naturally deconstruct it into a more organic arrangement. Play with enough campaign scope in a sufficiently hygienic sandbox, and this is what you'll end up with, more often than not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485690/#Comment_485690" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-10T13:59:13+00:00" title="June 10, 2019  1:59PM">1:59PM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was really 2097's lengthy and numerous posts about commitment to pre-game, offscreen prep and general neutral GMing that got me thinking about this type of play, since those things are basically absolute musts-haves for a campaign Braunstein of this type ( with and end-goal of warlord level kingdom building and related clashes).<br/><br/><br/>I have a hard time imagining this sort of play working at all without some blorb-o-riffic, broad-but-shallow, klockwerk universe building pre-game and offscreen game state tracking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon" title="Jon"><img alt="Jon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon">Jon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485692/#Comment_485692" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-10T14:04:38+00:00" title="June 10, 2019  2:04PM">2:04PM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob" rel="nofollow">komradebob</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I don't think West Marches has the same goal. <br/><br/>In WM, it seems more like bands of adventurers ... largely are non-hostile to one another anyway.</p></div></blockquote>\nFor what it's worth Ben certainly thought that players competing with one another was a core part of his West Marches experience.

Good Stuff, and great post-campaign analysis.<br/><br/><br/>You may be right about the player mix and competition. When I look at Braunstein, I tend to imagine a more "theatrical" sort of war gamer, perhaps the sort that chooses something like Diplomacy not simply for the challenge of the game, but to ham up the portrayal of their diplomat.<br/><br/><br/>Otoh, ultimately, there is at least some lightweight competitiveness going on there as well, and a fair percentage of the players at least having a goal of having their character become something like a self-made noble.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> <br/><br/>I suspect that this sort of game has to exist under very specific circumstances, and circumstances that very few of us have access to on a regular basis. Certainly, something like a regularly meeting game club, probably meeting in a physical location, is necessary. Regular work schedules for the players probably also a must, so they also have predictable off time.<br/><br/>Maybe it really is mostly an artifact of a certain time period's gaming culture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
