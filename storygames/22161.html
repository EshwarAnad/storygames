No-one else can even try.<br/><br/>Alchemists, rangers, scouts, outlanders and outriders are all torchmakers.<br/><br/>Other people get to make one DC 20 Wisdom check (not one per day \u2013 one total!) to see if they are torchmakers.<br/><br/>If they fail they have to learn how to become a torchmaker.<br/><br/>Picking up the nuances of torchmaking takes ten two-hour lessons from an alchemist, ranger or scout. (The other types of torchmakers can\u2019t teach all the nuances of torchmaking because they are relying on their own wisdom to fix problems on the fly, rather than knowledge of everything that could go wrong. Remember that the student is someone who as already failed the wisdom check or else they wouldn\u2019t be a student.)<br/><br/>It takes two minutes per torch if you had the stuff.<br/><br/>You need three things:\n<h2 id="the-stick">The Stick</h2>Finding the stick is trivial if there are trees. They don\u2019t have to be that dry.<br/><br/>Pine trees, due to their sap, don\u2019t need the wick or the burnination stabilizer if they are split the right way so the sap can be drawn up by the flame.\n<h2 id="the-wick">The Wick</h2>A piece of rope, some string, cloth rags (torn clothes?). You can\u2019t really forage for that using the forage rules but you might find some in the game. (like from an enemy\u2019s shirt or w/e).<br/><br/>If you\u2019re only living off nature and relying on the forage rules, you can wrap bark around the end and stuff it with grass, tiny pieces of wood, moss etc, or a cat tail (not a real cat\u2019s tail, the plant named cat tail, \u201ckaveldun\u201d in Swedish). You can forage for material for [1d6+wis]\xd710 torch wicks instead of foraging for food in a day. It\u2019s hard to find a place where this stuff is available but when you have found it, there is usually a lot. Each batch of wick materials is a small item though. Using this kind of crude wick material adds 5 minutes per torch.\n<h2 id="the-burnination-stabilizer">The Burnination Stabilizer</h2>You can use either of these:\n<ul><li>One hour\u2019s worth of lamp oil or even food oil.</li><li>Three day\u2019s worth of melted insect salve (or un-salvified ingredients, that works even better). You need some way to melt it (campfire + messkit). Adds 5 minutes per torch for a total of 7 minutes per torch.</li><li>A dead animal (fat). Adds 30 minutes base + 3 per torch, so one torch 35 minutes, two torches 40 minutes etc.</li></ul>Do not use pitch or tar as a burnination stabilizer if you\u2019re gonna take it in dungeons. It becomes super smoky.\\ Works OK for outdoor use. List these torches as \u201cpitch torch\u201d if you make them. But I haven\u2019t bothered to make rules for foraging for pitch or tar; this is just in case some module has a big tar pit or whatever.\n<h2 id="dropping-torches">Dropping Torches</h2>If you drop a torch you need make a DC 10 Wis save. If you fail it goes out, if you succeed it stays lit. If you drop it in water it just goes out.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486592/#Comment_486592" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-25T16:58:57+00:00" title="June 25, 2019  4:58PM">4:58PM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice overview here.<br/><br/>I\u2019m very curious why you give some characters an automatic ability to make torches, and others get a roll.

Did you already? Well, if it's part of basic training, yeah you did. Otherwise maybe you did and if you're living this life well you probably <i>should</i> have. And if you didn't, you didn't. I guess "everyone roll" is especially weird for rangers, where it'd be <i>weird</i> if they didn't know, and "just some classes know" says "no one trained to be a thief has ever learned how to make a torch during training" which is also weird.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486595/#Comment_486595" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-25T18:00:30+00:00" title="June 25, 2019  6:00PM">6:00PM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since 5e already has these nice proficiency rules, why not tie torchmaking to tool &amp; skill profs?
