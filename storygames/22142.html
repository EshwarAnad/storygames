All six players were strangers to me and to each other when we started. I advertised on meetup.com, specifically looking for people who wanted to learn to play D&amp;D, since I had seen some posts on the the local D&amp;D meetups from people looking to learn.<br/><br/>It's been going well overall. However, one thing that has still been awkward has been the characters just naturally conversing with each other in an organic and, well, "human" way.<br/><br/>This morning, I dreamed up a way to structure the conversation in a way that would be helpful. Tonight, we playtested it, and it worked great! Not perfectly, but the conversations and scenes flowed really nicely. The suggested topics often got ignored quickly, but that was fine, as my players quickly glommed on to the fact that the real goal was to reveal new information about the characters' personalities, thoughts, or pasts.<br/><br/>Check out what I am sarcastically calling <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H-UGAJMKGm0ZOQIGuVaDKeBee3_W3xYW13dLiU6Zmqo/edit" rel="nofollow">The D&amp;D Conversation Mini-Game</a>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486006/#Comment_486006" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-14T03:22:02+00:00" title="June 14, 2019  3:22AM">June 14</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22128/how-to-roleplay-talking-scenes#latest" rel="nofollow">Anything to get away from aimless tavern tea time</a>!<br/><br/>Glad to hear about your successful playtest, I want to hear more as you test this more!<br/>Although this might be <i>too</i> organic and human for me (i.e. aimless).<br/><br/>But my big problem lately has been to get the primitive screwheads to recognize when A Conversation Formally Starts\u2122.

Was stupid. Turns out the econ the least good part of Hillfolk. We\u2019ve been having the econ rules on the table dangling as this never-used appendix.<br/><br/>We also have two new players, I mean they\u2019ve played with us for a year now but since they joined with this campaign, they were not familiar with Hillfolk style play.<br/><br/>So since our <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/485246/#Comment_485246" rel="nofollow">last TPK</a> we\u2019ve committed to doing 1, the character setup. We put a pin on it because we wanted to get going for our guest player\u2665 but we\u2019re gonna really dig into it tomorrow. We threw the econ out and are hoping that the \u201cmagic part\u201d was the relationships.<br/><br/>We\u2019re also ready to add in some structure around conversations around rest times.

However, I tend to over-design rules sets, so I decided to correct for that, and go with a minimalist approach, and it actually worked fine.

Basic alternation. Not every conflict was a combat: one was dealing with a thunderstorm while sailing down a river. We won't necessarily stick to that as strictly in the next phase, which is going to be urban intrigue stuff in Waterdeep. They were quick scenes, too, these conversations, which is great.<br/><br/>Well, I think even if the GM wasn't prepping to the Characteristics it would be fine, because they're still present on the sheet, right? But if you're not awarding Inspiration regularly, which is sadly common, then implementing this mini-game would be disruptive, because suddenly it becomes the <i>only</i> way to earn Inspiration, which is not the intent.

(Although your \u201creview Characteristics that didn\u2019t get hit and rewrite them\u201d might correct it.)<br/><br/>If the game is all about fighting Orcs, say, but the interstitial scenes are all the PCs talking about how much they hate the (human) Empire, or how badly they want to find the Arc of the Covenant, for example, does the game start to feel like two separate, unrelated games are going on?<br/><br/>I hope that makes sense. I could explain in more detail, but I think you\u2019ll get my drift.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486102/#Comment_486102" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-15T02:13:55+00:00" title="June 15, 2019  2:13AM">June 15</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get your drift. The longest 5E game I played in, the Tomb of Annihilation run at a game store, was sometimes like that. There was interpersonal drama going on among a few of the PCs and actually an NPC played by the GM until she died horribly to a trap. That drama\u2014a love triangle, basically\u2014played out during those sorts of interstitial scenes when we were resting or whatever.<br/><br/>It had nothing to do with the adventure! But it was fine because the GM was emotionally invested in it himself. It bored some of the players, sometimes including me! But I think a drama like that, that is essentially separate from "THA PLOTTT," can actually work well if everyone is invested in it, whether actively or passively.<br/><br/>In my mini-game, the list of topics I chose I think helped steer the conversation in game-relevant directions. In fact, in the first conversation scene the PCs essentially over-rode the rolled topic\u2014long-term plans\u2014to talk about a more immediate threat, <i>which was great</i>.<br/><br/>And yes, the "if the scene ends up with us knowing more about the characters, but those important things weren't tied to your Characteristic, then change your fucking Bond to something fucking relevant, Bob" rule is designed to improve the game's feedback loops if they're not currently working. That's something that would function well, I think, even if the GM wasn't paying much attention to the Characteristics.<br/><br/>Again, though, the real risk is what happens if the mini-game becomes the only way to gain Inspiration, since it's the <i>only</i> time we pay attention to "who the characters are." As long as they have some chances, even if somewhat more rare ones, to display their true nature in other types of scenes, I think injecting some Inspiration tokens into the economy is fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_486225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient" title="Vivificient"><img alt="Vivificient" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/869/nJT73EZCYKXZO.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient">Vivificient</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486225/#Comment_486225" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-16T16:17:54+00:00" title="June 16, 2019  4:17PM">June 16</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very nice mini-game!  I think I'd enjoy playing with something like this.<br/><br/>An interesting feature is that you have to target a specific (randomly selected) TIBF, like a random encounter table for your own character.<br/><br/>I wonder what would happen if you applied that principle to the conflict scenes directly.  Like, we're about to fight some orcs--but first two of the players (one player?  all players?) roll on their traits, and have to try to work the selected ones into the combat scene.  Then after the combat, we evaluate if they succeeded and award inspiration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient" title="Vivificient"><img alt="Vivificient" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/869/nJT73EZCYKXZO.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient">Vivificient</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486226/#Comment_486226" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-16T16:19:38+00:00" title="June 16, 2019  4:19PM">June 16</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm thinking of it because of Keith Johnstone's game where you have to act out a murder scene, except you're given some completely different motivation to act like "Clean the house", so you do the murder almost as a side thought while focusing on making sure it doesn't make any mess on the floor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_486229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486229/#Comment_486229" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-16T16:22:00+00:00" title="June 16, 2019  4:22PM">June 16</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice!

I do think it would be nice to work character portrayal and Insp-earning into combat scenes more. I've found that to be something that simply requires a higher degree of player skill and confidence than the current group I'm running has. I've seen some players do it pretty regularly. It doesn't even necessarily always fall under the rubric of "flashlight dropping," either: it can be something that's a reasonable tactical decision but clearly different than what the character would have done otherwise.<br/><br/>I remember in the opening battle of "Night's Dark Terror," when the PCs' riverboat is ambushed from the shore, my friend Sam had his ranger dive into the river and try to swim to shore to fight the enemy as a result of a Trait. It wasn't the *worst* move ever, but it was definitely ballsy and Insp-worthy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
