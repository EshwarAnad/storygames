The more unshared true knowledge in your game, the more real your game can be. This means that...<br/><br/>2. One way to make your game more real is to ask your fellow players not to share what they know with you. This is fun, but it can't work by itself, because first...<br/><br/>3. You need enough ambiguity between the fictional events of your game and the players' expectations of them to allow the players to develop different interpretations, different working knowledge, not of the fictional events themselves, but of the implicit fictional cause-and-effect principles underlying them. And for best results...<br/><br/>4. You should create ambiguities between the fictional events of your game and <i>your own</i> expectations of them, in any way you can, as player or as GM, as well as accepting ambiguity as others create it, and you should allow ambiguities to accumulate instead of trying to resolve them, until you have no choice but to interpret them instead of understanding them. But to make THIS work...<br/><br/>5. You need game systems that are sufficiently opaque, sufficiently rigorous, don't invite routine challenges to their results, don't reward mechanical efforts to resolve ambiguities, and expect or demand you to go along with them anyway. Sandra's blorb principles provide one approach to such a system, prep-oriented; Meg's, Emily's and my freeform game provides another, canon-oriented; and my game, The Wizard's Grimoire, despite my having downplayed it before now, provides a prospective third, opacity-oriented.<br/><br/>There are surely any number more approaches, and any number of games that provide examples for these three approaches, but still, few roads lead here. Most approaches to games, and most example games, don't.<br/><br/>So that's my preliminary hypothesis. Here's its first test.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Sandra">@Sandra</a>, here I'm considering your principles to do these following crucial functions (non-exhaustive):\n<ul><li><b>Create rigor in your game systems.</b> For example, as GM, you don't routinely ignore die rolls or overwrite your prep just because you had an idea at the moment.</li>\n<li><b>Minimize routine challenges to fictional events on the players' parts.</b> For example, as a player, I don't shout out what I think should be behind the door or routinely ask for a different ruling when I don't prefer the one you've made.</li>\n<li><b>Create opacity, space, between players' expectations and the real fictional events of play.</b> For example, as a player, I should expect things to happen that I didn't expect and don't immediately understand, and when they do happen, I should accept that they have happened, even if they don't (yet) make any dang sense to me. It's uncool of me to routinely demand to understand why something happened before I'll accept that yes, it happened.</li>\n<li><b>Provide no mechanisms by which players can assert their own opinions directly into the fictional cause and effect of the game.</b> For instance, no "give your explanation for what's going on, and on a 10+, you're right." Not even any "ask the GM what's going on, and on a 10+, she has to tell you," except conceivably under very strict limitations.</li></ul>\nMy questions for you! I'm not asking you to confirm or refute or even address my hypothesis in whole yet, it's way too baby for that. Just a couple of preliminary questions.<br/><br/>1. Are there any of these crucial functions that you'd say that no, in fact, your principles DON'T do?<br/><br/>2. I'm calling them "crucial functions," but are there any of them that you'd say that you could freely do away with, and still have blorb? (For instance, blorb doesn't need rigor in your game system, or blorb can tolerate routine challenges to fictional events.)<br/><br/>3. Do you see how Meg's, Emily's and my principles of radically co-GMed, live-negotiated play did these same crucial functions for us, despite running basically completely counter to your principles?<br/><br/>Whew.<br/><br/>Sandra, you've torn the roof off of my brain. I hope you can forgive me some thrashing and flailing!<br/><br/>-Vincent                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486489/#Comment_486489" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-21T15:02:40+00:00" title="June 21, 2019  3:02PM">June 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reality as a super-authority.<br/>Why do you need ambiguity ?

Just like you and I must sometimes interpret why something happened in the real world, instead of knowing, ambiguous fictional cause-and-effect allows you and me to interpret why something fictional happened in the game, instead of knowing.<br/><br/>I'm talking about, like, we both agree that there's a bridge over the river here, with a big pylon holding it up, no problem. But I think that the big pylon probably means that it's leftover from the fantasy-Romans, and you think that maybe it is, but more likely it's newer. The GM's perfectly happy to describe the bridge in as much detail as we require, as long as we take the time to hang out and examine it, but neither of us are entitled to a definitive answer.<br/><br/>This is sort of, to me, a minimum ambiguity: the GM knows the answer, but isn't required to tell us outright. We can do our own work and come to our own conclusions. The game allows us to be right, to be wrong, and/or to disagree.<br/><br/>Traditionally, people have interpreted this ambiguity from the point of view of the GM's authority and ownership of the game world, but my mirror story points to the ambiguity itself as the crucial point. In a co-GMed game, ambiguity like this can exist between the GMs, and can increase the game's sense of reality there too!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Khimus" title="Khimus"><img alt="Khimus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Khimus">Khimus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486495/#Comment_486495" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-21T16:15:47+00:00" title="June 21, 2019  4:15PM">June 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a question:<br/><br/>Would this ambiguity enhance the sense of reality if it extended to the GM himself? To build on the example you give, let's say the GM doesn't know either the true nature of the pylon. He has the description of the pylon and its effects, and has decided how likely it is that it's Roman instead of newer (let's say 1-5 in a d6 that it's Roman). He'll hold off rolling until the last possible moment, so, in a sense, it's a surprise for him too.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_486497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486497/#Comment_486497" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-21T16:26:47+00:00" title="June 21, 2019  4:26PM">June 21</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2019 4:35PM by David_Berg.">edited June 21</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.  In the context of a single-GMed "exploration and discovery" adventure RPG, all of the above reads to me as, "Well, yeah, of course."  Reality-ambiguity-interpretation is a big chunk of what <a href="/forums/profile/contracycle">@contracycle</a> and I used to ramble about a few years back.  But it is neat to see it spelled out this way and noted that it doesn't actually require the single GM.<br/><br/>I could blather at length about how Delve goes about all of those things if you want, Vincent.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  It's pretty close to the traditional thing you describe, but I'd say it's more about GM knowledge and limited communication rather than authority and ownership.

Maybe there's more to it, but at least that : getting out of the way for the players to have a direct relation to the object they interact with. It follows that the symmetry is also in the format of Q and A as exact reactions to the payers actions. But, a word about the terms, it's not "create opacity" or "create the unexpected" as much as "resist the urge to explain, give away or reassure with mechanical terminology". (This is typical of progressive education.)<br/><br/>The case of co-GMs is a special case, and doesn't follow strictly. If the bridge has a known history, the ambiguity is unwelcome. But maybe you mean something like Barthe's <i>punctum</i>. I'll explain it with a VR analogy : in a virtual environment created by computer, chances are the general apparence of things will be "filled with regularity". So your idea maybe to introduce something "out of the way", a grain of sand (the punctum) that catches the attention as un-inventable. Something like : "always mix your random tables fresh"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_486502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486502/#Comment_486502" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-21T16:57:09+00:00" title="June 21, 2019  4:57PM">June 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm really glad to see this, Vincent! This is mental gears churning and new ways of looking at things being examined from a different angle, all thanks to Sandra's tireless efforts here on S-G as she explores and extends her particular playstyle. Fantastic!<br/><br/>I'm also really glad Dave showed up to mention Delve; I would be quite curious to see how you two see many of these features showing up in design and play in manners which aren't explained in the old-fashioned way ("the GM holds all the truths and keeps them secret!"). Vincent's new game is a very interesting example of this effect, to me, for that reason (since it breaks that paradigm and looks for new ways to create this effect).<br/><br/>I think Cary and Jay's "spicy dice" Middle Earth game is another interesting case to consider in the light of these ideas. I've been bringing it up a lot in these discussions, but no one's really engaged with that; looking at the game in the light of these concepts could be enlightening, as well.<br/><br/>More than anything, though, I'm looking forward to Sandra's take on all of this. My guess is that she will agree with some of it and disagree with other aspects, and I'm really excited and curious to see which and how.<br/><br/>Thank you for this lovely post!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" title="Silmenume"><img alt="Silmenume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">Silmenume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486506/#Comment_486506" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-21T19:11:20+00:00" title="June 21, 2019  7:11PM">June 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Vincent,<br/><br/>Hope you've been well, it been years!<br/><br/>The game I've been playing in and posting about centralizes as a process of playy the last three of the four of your bullet points.

For example, players lie to a police officer, but neither I nor them know if he bought it. I don't decide it at that instant either, but hold on until later, planning for a moment when the police officer could set them a trap or ambush them (for example, when the suspect is alone in the street). That's when I roll to determine if he believed them or not.

A low number of connections to other content makes randomly generated content initially seem less real: When I generate random encounters for the Wilder lands I always think about their relationship to what's already there (e.g. bandits in a dragon's territory might pay tribute, worship it, live in fear etc.).

I know I'm asking you to keep an open mind here. I'm asking you to entertain the idea that <i>the thing</i> in your mirror story, I recognize the same thing in my wand story, even though the stories seem super different. I know you don't recognize it in my wand story yet. My task is to reconcile our two stories so that they both make sense in the same terms, so that blorb, which gives you your experience, and ... uh ... garst, which gave me mine, while going about it in completely incompatible ways, do the same thing.<br/><br/>And I'll say that blorb's probably the better approach. I haven't played garst for a decade plus, because it's long and particular to set up. The commitments required aren't convenient for me to make right now. So my goal here isn't to supercede blorb, even though I'll talk a lot about contra-blorb techniques. They're, and I say it in informed seriousness, probably worse techniques.<br/><br/>And I'll reiterate that while I think that potentially there are several approaches to this - blorb, garst, possibly others represented here on SG, and also others yet unconsidered - most approaches to roleplaying do something else entirely. This isn't normal roleplaying, it's an outlier. This is what makes it useful for RPG theory, and efforts to redefine it into the mainstream are misconsidered.<br/><br/>And finally, this experience is irrational. I'm here looking at techniques we use to provoke ourselves into a social and psychological circumstance where we share an irrational experience with other people. I find value in this, in part because of its irrationality. Those of you who shy away from irrational ideas might want to sit this one out.<br/><br/><b>Diagrams</b><br/><br/>So this might be true:<br/><br/><b>Blorb vs Garst</b><br/><img alt="Equivalent, separate Blorb and Garst processes: Principles -&lt; Actions -&lt; The Game is Real -&lt; Interpretations" src="http://lumpley.com/images/blorbvsgarst.jpg"/><br/><br/>The realness that you experience via blorb might not be the realness that I experienced via garst at all. We have nothing to learn from each other, any effort to compare our dissimilar interpretations, principles, and actions to arrive at shared underlying processes is doomed. We don't, in fact, share underlying processes.<br/><br/>(This is where "what makes things feel solid for different people?" would take us, by the way.)<br/><br/>But I don't think this is true at all! I think that the truth is much weirder.<br/><br/>I think that the truth is:<br/><br/><b>Blorb <img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/> Garst</b><br/><img alt="Symmetrical Blorb and Garst processes, sharing The Game Can Seem Real and The Game is Real" src="http://lumpley.com/images/blorbplusgarst.jpg"/><br/><br/>I think that the realness that you experienced in your mirror story and the realness that I experienced in my wand story are the same realness, created by the same underlying processes (represented by "The Game Can Seem Real"), even though our interpretations, principles, and actions aren't compatible.<br/><br/><b>Am I right?</b><br/><br/>I don't know!

Part of the way we create the buy-in is that I <i>can</i> sometimes <b>do</b> provide these explanations. The wolves are in the room because the prep says so, see here [shows prep, covers rest of page].<br/>The transparency of method.<br/>But.<br/>When someone is consistently questioning it it does become annoying. We play drop-in/drop-out so this guy isn't at every session, but it's frustrating to run for him. I think it's because instead of asking "what makes this real", he is asking it in a way that implies "this shouldn't be real, you have to change it". And I'm like, I can't change it.

tier-2 random table is the right choice for the game-world? What if there is pushback? Can it be collaborative? Is the right approach "let one person recede from playing and enter patch-mode; they apply a patch and re-enter playing; now their patch is canon and has become the choice and we go with it; once everyone has receded after a session, if you think the patch-mode action was suboptimal feel free to discuss how patch-mode might be improved in the future".<br/><br/>Wands: when you discover a new fact that contradicts what you thought was true, is your procedure to dismiss your own thoughts, reject reality, inspect reality, or what? Does it depend?<br/><br/>Discover a new fact == someone says something. That's what it means to discover a new fact, because you are collectively trusting that you're all saying things from a very, very similar idea of the game world.<br/><br/>Contradicts what you thought was true == occasionally, you won't actually be on the same page, possibly because of something fundamental or possibly because you just never considered there might be raiders and they just never considered everyone has fled the area.<br/><br/>Dismiss your own: "oh not everyone fled, the raiders are here"<br/>Reject reality: "there aren't raiders, wonder why [they] said there were"<br/>Inspect reality: "say aloud 'if everyone fled, how are there raiders' or offer your own explanation proactively"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486584/#Comment_486584" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-24T20:55:15+00:00" title="June 24, 2019  8:55PM">June 24</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My take on that, Guy, is that the traditional DM-plays-world / players-plays-characters is a match made in heaven for blorby play.<br/><br/>You don't introduce new tables at the tier-2. At tier-2, you apply the tables you have. At tier-3 is when you can &amp; have to introduce new tier-1 and tier-2 stuff.
