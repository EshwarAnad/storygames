The more unshared true knowledge in your game, the more real your game can be. This means that...<br/><br/>2. One way to make your game more real is to ask your fellow players not to share what they know with you. This is fun, but it can't work by itself, because first...<br/><br/>3. You need enough ambiguity between the fictional events of your game and the players' expectations of them to allow the players to develop different interpretations, different working knowledge, not of the fictional events themselves, but of the implicit fictional cause-and-effect principles underlying them. And for best results...<br/><br/>4. You should create ambiguities between the fictional events of your game and <i>your own</i> expectations of them, in any way you can, as player or as GM, as well as accepting ambiguity as others create it, and you should allow ambiguities to accumulate instead of trying to resolve them, until you have no choice but to interpret them instead of understanding them. But to make THIS work...<br/><br/>5. You need game systems that are sufficiently opaque, sufficiently rigorous, don't invite routine challenges to their results, don't reward mechanical efforts to resolve ambiguities, and expect or demand you to go along with them anyway. Sandra's blorb principles provide one approach to such a system, prep-oriented; Meg's, Emily's and my freeform game provides another, canon-oriented; and my game, The Wizard's Grimoire, despite my having downplayed it before now, provides a prospective third, opacity-oriented.<br/><br/>There are surely any number more approaches, and any number of games that provide examples for these three approaches, but still, few roads lead here. Most approaches to games, and most example games, don't.<br/><br/>So that's my preliminary hypothesis. Here's its first test.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Sandra">@Sandra</a>, here I'm considering your principles to do these following crucial functions (non-exhaustive):\n<ul><li><b>Create rigor in your game systems.</b> For example, as GM, you don't routinely ignore die rolls or overwrite your prep just because you had an idea at the moment.</li>\n<li><b>Minimize routine challenges to fictional events on the players' parts.</b> For example, as a player, I don't shout out what I think should be behind the door or routinely ask for a different ruling when I don't prefer the one you've made.</li>\n<li><b>Create opacity, space, between players' expectations and the real fictional events of play.</b> For example, as a player, I should expect things to happen that I didn't expect and don't immediately understand, and when they do happen, I should accept that they have happened, even if they don't (yet) make any dang sense to me. It's uncool of me to routinely demand to understand why something happened before I'll accept that yes, it happened.</li>\n<li><b>Provide no mechanisms by which players can assert their own opinions directly into the fictional cause and effect of the game.</b> For instance, no "give your explanation for what's going on, and on a 10+, you're right." Not even any "ask the GM what's going on, and on a 10+, she has to tell you," except conceivably under very strict limitations.</li></ul>\nMy questions for you! I'm not asking you to confirm or refute or even address my hypothesis in whole yet, it's way too baby for that. Just a couple of preliminary questions.<br/><br/>1. Are there any of these crucial functions that you'd say that no, in fact, your principles DON'T do?<br/><br/>2. I'm calling them "crucial functions," but are there any of them that you'd say that you could freely do away with, and still have blorb? (For instance, blorb doesn't need rigor in your game system, or blorb can tolerate routine challenges to fictional events.)<br/><br/>3. Do you see how Meg's, Emily's and my principles of radically co-GMed, live-negotiated play did these same crucial functions for us, despite running basically completely counter to your principles?<br/><br/>Whew.<br/><br/>Sandra, you've torn the roof off of my brain. I hope you can forgive me some thrashing and flailing!<br/><br/>-Vincent                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486489/#Comment_486489" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-21T15:02:40+00:00" title="June 21, 2019  3:02PM">June 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reality as a super-authority.<br/>Why do you need ambiguity ?

Just like you and I must sometimes interpret why something happened in the real world, instead of knowing, ambiguous fictional cause-and-effect allows you and me to interpret why something fictional happened in the game, instead of knowing.<br/><br/>I'm talking about, like, we both agree that there's a bridge over the river here, with a big pylon holding it up, no problem. But I think that the big pylon probably means that it's leftover from the fantasy-Romans, and you think that maybe it is, but more likely it's newer. The GM's perfectly happy to describe the bridge in as much detail as we require, as long as we take the time to hang out and examine it, but neither of us are entitled to a definitive answer.<br/><br/>This is sort of, to me, a minimum ambiguity: the GM knows the answer, but isn't required to tell us outright. We can do our own work and come to our own conclusions. The game allows us to be right, to be wrong, and/or to disagree.<br/><br/>Traditionally, people have interpreted this ambiguity from the point of view of the GM's authority and ownership of the game world, but my mirror story points to the ambiguity itself as the crucial point. In a co-GMed game, ambiguity like this can exist between the GMs, and can increase the game's sense of reality there too!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Khimus" title="Khimus"><img alt="Khimus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Khimus">Khimus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486495/#Comment_486495" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-21T16:15:47+00:00" title="June 21, 2019  4:15PM">June 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a question:<br/><br/>Would this ambiguity enhance the sense of reality if it extended to the GM himself? To build on the example you give, let's say the GM doesn't know either the true nature of the pylon. He has the description of the pylon and its effects, and has decided how likely it is that it's Roman instead of newer (let's say 1-5 in a d6 that it's Roman). He'll hold off rolling until the last possible moment, so, in a sense, it's a surprise for him too.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_486497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486497/#Comment_486497" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-21T16:26:47+00:00" title="June 21, 2019  4:26PM">June 21</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2019 4:35PM by David_Berg.">edited June 21</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.  In the context of a single-GMed "exploration and discovery" adventure RPG, all of the above reads to me as, "Well, yeah, of course."  Reality-ambiguity-interpretation is a big chunk of what <a href="/forums/profile/contracycle">@contracycle</a> and I used to ramble about a few years back.  But it is neat to see it spelled out this way and noted that it doesn't actually require the single GM.<br/><br/>I could blather at length about how Delve goes about all of those things if you want, Vincent.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  It's pretty close to the traditional thing you describe, but I'd say it's more about GM knowledge and limited communication rather than authority and ownership.

Maybe there's more to it, but at least that : getting out of the way for the players to have a direct relation to the object they interact with. It follows that the symmetry is also in the format of Q and A as exact reactions to the payers actions. But, a word about the terms, it's not "create opacity" or "create the unexpected" as much as "resist the urge to explain, give away or reassure with mechanical terminology". (This is typical of progressive education.)<br/><br/>The case of co-GMs is a special case, and doesn't follow strictly. If the bridge has a known history, the ambiguity is unwelcome. But maybe you mean something like Barthe's <i>punctum</i>. I'll explain it with a VR analogy : in a virtual environment created by computer, chances are the general apparence of things will be "filled with regularity". So your idea maybe to introduce something "out of the way", a grain of sand (the punctum) that catches the attention as un-inventable. Something like : "always mix your random tables fresh"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_486502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486502/#Comment_486502" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-21T16:57:09+00:00" title="June 21, 2019  4:57PM">June 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm really glad to see this, Vincent! This is mental gears churning and new ways of looking at things being examined from a different angle, all thanks to Sandra's tireless efforts here on S-G as she explores and extends her particular playstyle. Fantastic!<br/><br/>I'm also really glad Dave showed up to mention Delve; I would be quite curious to see how you two see many of these features showing up in design and play in manners which aren't explained in the old-fashioned way ("the GM holds all the truths and keeps them secret!"). Vincent's new game is a very interesting example of this effect, to me, for that reason (since it breaks that paradigm and looks for new ways to create this effect).<br/><br/>I think Cary and Jay's "spicy dice" Middle Earth game is another interesting case to consider in the light of these ideas. I've been bringing it up a lot in these discussions, but no one's really engaged with that; looking at the game in the light of these concepts could be enlightening, as well.<br/><br/>More than anything, though, I'm looking forward to Sandra's take on all of this. My guess is that she will agree with some of it and disagree with other aspects, and I'm really excited and curious to see which and how.<br/><br/>Thank you for this lovely post!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" title="Silmenume"><img alt="Silmenume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">Silmenume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486506/#Comment_486506" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-21T19:11:20+00:00" title="June 21, 2019  7:11PM">June 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Vincent,<br/><br/>Hope you've been well, it been years!<br/><br/>The game I've been playing in and posting about centralizes as a process of playy the last three of the four of your bullet points.

For example, players lie to a police officer, but neither I nor them know if he bought it. I don't decide it at that instant either, but hold on until later, planning for a moment when the police officer could set them a trap or ambush them (for example, when the suspect is alone in the street). That's when I roll to determine if he believed them or not.

A low number of connections to other content makes randomly generated content initially seem less real: When I generate random encounters for the Wilder lands I always think about their relationship to what's already there (e.g. bandits in a dragon's territory might pay tribute, worship it, live in fear etc.).

I know I'm asking you to keep an open mind here. I'm asking you to entertain the idea that <i>the thing</i> in your mirror story, I recognize the same thing in my wand story, even though the stories seem super different. I know you don't recognize it in my wand story yet. My task is to reconcile our two stories so that they both make sense in the same terms, so that blorb, which gives you your experience, and ... uh ... garst, which gave me mine, while going about it in completely incompatible ways, do the same thing.<br/><br/>And I'll say that blorb's probably the better approach. I haven't played garst for a decade plus, because it's long and particular to set up. The commitments required aren't convenient for me to make right now. So my goal here isn't to supercede blorb, even though I'll talk a lot about contra-blorb techniques. They're, and I say it in informed seriousness, probably worse techniques.<br/><br/>And I'll reiterate that while I think that potentially there are several approaches to this - blorb, garst, possibly others represented here on SG, and also others yet unconsidered - most approaches to roleplaying do something else entirely. This isn't normal roleplaying, it's an outlier. This is what makes it useful for RPG theory, and efforts to redefine it into the mainstream are misconsidered.<br/><br/>And finally, this experience is irrational. I'm here looking at techniques we use to provoke ourselves into a social and psychological circumstance where we share an irrational experience with other people. I find value in this, in part because of its irrationality. Those of you who shy away from irrational ideas might want to sit this one out.<br/><br/><b>Diagrams</b><br/><br/>So this might be true:<br/><br/><b>Blorb vs Garst</b><br/><img alt="Equivalent, separate Blorb and Garst processes: Principles -&lt; Actions -&lt; The Game is Real -&lt; Interpretations" src="http://lumpley.com/images/blorbvsgarst.jpg"/><br/><br/>The realness that you experience via blorb might not be the realness that I experienced via garst at all. We have nothing to learn from each other, any effort to compare our dissimilar interpretations, principles, and actions to arrive at shared underlying processes is doomed. We don't, in fact, share underlying processes.<br/><br/>(This is where "what makes things feel solid for different people?" would take us, by the way.)<br/><br/>But I don't think this is true at all! I think that the truth is much weirder.<br/><br/>I think that the truth is:<br/><br/><b>Blorb <img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/> Garst</b><br/><img alt="Symmetrical Blorb and Garst processes, sharing The Game Can Seem Real and The Game is Real" src="http://lumpley.com/images/blorbplusgarst.jpg"/><br/><br/>I think that the realness that you experienced in your mirror story and the realness that I experienced in my wand story are the same realness, created by the same underlying processes (represented by "The Game Can Seem Real"), even though our interpretations, principles, and actions aren't compatible.<br/><br/><b>Am I right?</b><br/><br/>I don't know!

Part of the way we create the buy-in is that I <i>can</i> sometimes <b>do</b> provide these explanations. The wolves are in the room because the prep says so, see here [shows prep, covers rest of page].<br/>The transparency of method.<br/>But.<br/>When someone is consistently questioning it it does become annoying. We play drop-in/drop-out so this guy isn't at every session, but it's frustrating to run for him. I think it's because instead of asking "what makes this real", he is asking it in a way that implies "this shouldn't be real, you have to change it". And I'm like, I can't change it.

tier-2 random table is the right choice for the game-world? What if there is pushback? Can it be collaborative? Is the right approach "let one person recede from playing and enter patch-mode; they apply a patch and re-enter playing; now their patch is canon and has become the choice and we go with it; once everyone has receded after a session, if you think the patch-mode action was suboptimal feel free to discuss how patch-mode might be improved in the future".<br/><br/>Wands: when you discover a new fact that contradicts what you thought was true, is your procedure to dismiss your own thoughts, reject reality, inspect reality, or what? Does it depend?<br/><br/>Discover a new fact == someone says something. That's what it means to discover a new fact, because you are collectively trusting that you're all saying things from a very, very similar idea of the game world.<br/><br/>Contradicts what you thought was true == occasionally, you won't actually be on the same page, possibly because of something fundamental or possibly because you just never considered there might be raiders and they just never considered everyone has fled the area.<br/><br/>Dismiss your own: "oh not everyone fled, the raiders are here"<br/>Reject reality: "there aren't raiders, wonder why [they] said there were"<br/>Inspect reality: "say aloud 'if everyone fled, how are there raiders' or offer your own explanation proactively"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486584/#Comment_486584" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-24T20:55:15+00:00" title="June 24, 2019  8:55PM">June 24</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My take on that, Guy, is that the traditional DM-plays-world / players-plays-characters is a match made in heaven for blorby play.<br/><br/>You don't introduce new tables at the tier-2.

In our case, most of a decade developing the canon, AND the specific way that we developed it, which cultivated each of us as independent authorities on it.<br/><br/>I can't tell you how much preliminary work went into it. It's not practical to reproduce like blorb is.<br/><br/>But I can try to tell you how it...\n<ul><li><b>Created rigor in our game systems &amp; minimized routine challenges to fictional events on the players' parts:</b><br/>Because we were each independent authorities on both the game's canon and on what happened live in play, we couldn't dismiss each others' visions. Where blorb creates rigor and minimizes routine objections by establishing an unassailable GM - backed up by transparency when necessary - we did it by establishing that each of us were coequal authorities. Backed up by transparency when necessary!<br/><br/>If I were going to routinely challenge, say, Emily's fictional contributions, I shouldn't keep playing the game with her. If she were going to routinely challenge mine, she shouldn't keep playing the game with me.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><b>Created opacity, space, between players' expectations and the real fictional events of play:</b><br/>We were <i>independent</i> authorities on the canon. We developed the canon over, like I say, most of a decade, and we did it in a number of different games, with a number of different groups of people.<br/><br/>When Meg, Emily and I sat down to play, our agreement was that (1) everything that had happened in those other games, had really happened. (2) Or maybe they hadn't <i>exactly</i>, but these were the stories that got spread around about them. (3) Whoever was there when it happened, we'd take their word for it. (4) Where our memories don't agree, that's okay, our memories don't agree. When did two people's memories ever agree?<br/><br/>We also assigned each other research areas. For instance, it was my job to find out everything I could about the rules and traditions of the Order of Hermes, so that we'd have an authority on the topic in the group. Meg and Emily would defer to me on those matters. It was my job to decide the canon in this case, right, but I knew from experience to preserve space for interpretation in "my" canon so that I could share authority when the time came. Emily's job was to know about the Mongol Invasion, which would come to threaten us in just a couple of years. Meg's job was to know about our clothing, medicine, and langauge.<br/><br/>Anyway, as a result, whenever Meg or Emily said anything about anything, I might be surprised by it. My expectations where never 100% correct, because they knew a whole lot of things that I just never knew.<br/><br/>All the way down to, when our characters would gossip with each other, ALL KINDS of wonderful tidbits would come out, details that one of us knew but the other didn't happen to know, glimpses of events that we could legitimately try to piece together into a whole, second-hand stories that really were second-hand, hazy memories of something that actually happened, all kinds.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><b>Provided no mechanisms by which we could assert our own opinions directly into the fictional cause and effect of the game:</b><br/>For instance, there was this one minor character whom I believed to be gay, but Meg believed to be straight. Who was right? Our rules didn't let us resolve it purely as players, we couldn't just decide, we'd have to come up with a way to put it to the test. We'd have to follow this guy around like meddling busybodies until he got laid!<br/><br/>We had other things to do with our attention, so to this day none of us know who he was sleeping with, or whether he was celibate (which would surprise me, frankly), or what.</li></ul>\nIt's so hard to communicate clearly! I could write 100 pages and scratch the surface.<br/><br/>But garst, like I say, isn't what I'm pursuing here. What I'd like to pursue is the role of canon offscreen gamestate in creating the feeling of truth, of reality.<br/><br/>I really, honestly, truly believe that this one minor character in our game, I forget his name even, but he could have been sleeping with somebody without our knowing it. All of those minor characters had private lives that we didn't pry much into.<br/><br/>This is just a case of canon offscreen gamestate. A canon fact, in principle knowable, but as it happens known to none of us. I don't have any problem with that.<br/><br/>But my hypothesis is that the process of creating these unknown truths - or known but unshared truths, since to me the truths that Meg and Emily knew but I didn't are indistinguishable from the truths that none of us knew - is what GIVES a game this kind of irrational reality. Unproved, untested, but that's my hypothesis.<br/><br/>Uh. I have followup questions about blorb!

Not myth of the Vikings or the Greeks but myth as constructed and lived by pre-literate tribal cultures.  The accumulation of the canon, the various authorities/sources, that growth of the myth (canon) is accomplished using existing structures and not player stated abstractions.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Play using existing structures would include</span> "following around" the PC to "see" what is learned even though you players are the creators <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is an example of that type of play</span>.<br/><br/>If this is the reason, as opposed to something like its very personal and difficult to share, then there is good reason for your difficulty in expressing yourself.  To outsiders such myth is extremely opaque and the process of its creation difficult to understand as there is no analogue to it western culture.  We really don't have a good vocabulary or idea scaffolding culturally to relate to it.  If you are the reading type you might want to read (or possibly reread as the case may be) <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=13560.0" rel="nofollow">this</a>, <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=10283.0" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=14371.0" rel="nofollow">this</a>.

I'll describe them briefly, and you'll have to tell me whether either is close to what you're thinking about here, or not.<br/><br/>1. We are playing together, and all making things up - as you do, in an RPG. However, we take turns and sometimes our contributions overlap and intertwine. Over time, no single person is "making up" enough things to feel like an author; the contributions of the other players take up enough space in what's being created that I can start to "feel" as though I'm exploring something real, even though I'm also making up pieces of it as we go. <br/><br/>In the context of this NPC, I'm really curious about him, and at some point another player says something which determines his nature, so I feel like I'm discovering it, even though it was actually my friend making it up. But we do it enough, back and forth, that none of us feel like we're making everything up as we go along.<br/><br/>There's a certain magic to "forgetting" that you're making contributions in a game like this, and picking your moments; over time, the contributions start to meld together and become hard to tell apart.<br/><br/>2. We are playing, as above, but none of us want to *decide* what the deal with this NPC is. Instead, we colour around the margins, leaving that space. However, at some point, we colour enough around this space that it becomes obvious that there is only one possible answer to the question.<br/><br/>Perhaps I describe him coming out of a certain house, and then you happen to remember that so-and-so lives at that house, and then a third person says that he's got a bit of a sly grin on his face - so uncharacteristically! - and... we think about it for a second, and then we all look at each other and we go, "Ohhhhhhh!" Now we know. We weren't planning to find out, no one was trying to decide, but suddenly there it is, clear as day.<br/><br/>Are either of those what you're talking about here?<br/><br/>Of course, Sandra gets at a similar point/question in a very clear way here, which I hope you will respond to (if you have some other thoughts on the matter):\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Put another way; the point in contention is <strong>\u201cProvided no mechanisms by which we could assert our own opinions directly into the fictional cause and effect of the game\u201d</strong> and, well, in the situation that arose around this guy, it seems to me that the <em>only</em> way that you could resolve it would for one of you to assert his or her own opinion directly as fact.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486689/#Comment_486689" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-07-03T12:59:55+00:00" title="July  3, 2019 12:59PM">July 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sandra,<br/><br/>I'm glad you're engaging in this discussion with Vincent.

The first time I thought everything was business as usual. But then I went home and read the module and went "huh\u2026 all of that stuff was really there? Those bugs were really there, those traps were really there\u2026 and there was so much more to this place that we never found". It was more of a "huh" than a "mind blown" but then a few weex later I play again &amp; then mirror story.<br/><br/>That also originated transparency of method when I started my own group to DM for: I realized that part of the strong mindblowing effect during mirror story was that I <i>knew</i> that the stuff was really there in the prep. We do way less transparency of method now after playing together for five years.<br/><br/>A lot of the early blorb flame wars on here are about transparency of method, curtains etc.<br/><br/>So the way the players can break make-believe symmetry is for them to Schr\xf6dingerify particular traits (such as spell selection or equipment loadout) related to their character. That breaks the integrity of the game.

My weak understanding of this is something like this. An analogy:<br/><br/>The off-stage canon gamestate is a black box, in the computer sense. An API. It has well-understood ways to interface with it during the game. The GM probably plays a role in operating it and might understand how it works, but they're not coding it on the fly. <br/><br/>Or if computer analogies make you uncomfortable, it's a machine and the GM is operating it on behalf of the players. You put actions into a funnel on the top, turn the crank, and it processes the actions and *clunk*, out comes some stuff.<br/><br/>The players do stuff for their characters. The GM and players input those actions into the machine and the GM turns the crank, and out comes <i>evidence of a new gamestate</i>. <br/><br/>Note, <i>a new gamestate</i> doesn't come out, because the gamestate never comes out. It lives in the machine. In fact, it's hard to tell where machine ends and gamestate begins; they're probably the same, or very close to it. (Note how the Big Model calls <i>all of this stuff</i> (System, Setting, Character, etc.) "Exploration" and nearly equates it, but not quite, with the Shared Imagined Space!)<br/><br/>When you're playing--and probably if you're GMing, if you're doing it "properly" (for blorb)--then you can't control the machine. That means that you can only guess what the output will be for a given set of inputs. The GM doesn't know--she has to turn the crank to find out. <br/><br/>It seems to me that the machine can be different things.<br/><br/>In blorb, it's prep and canon and gloricle and stuff. In other games that respect the black boxness of the machine, it's a shared understanding of how the canon works. I think the latter might be more what Vincent &amp; Meg &amp; Emily did, what Silmenume does. Though Silmenume's group invests more of that "machine power" in the GM, and V/M/E seem to have shared it more.<br/><br/>Is any of that right? <br/><br/>ETA:<br/><br/>Just read your <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22086/the-diegesis-easily-explained" rel="nofollow">Diegesis</a> post, so sory about SIS stuff.

This game Engine might include the rules as written, interpretations of those rules, additions to those rules, social contracts, "this is how we do it but we never really talked about it," and so on. It also includes data, like Gloricle stuff. The Engine probably includes techniques you can use to modify the Engine itself (not all groups use this).<br/><br/>The Engine changes the Game State. Techniques can be used to get feedback about the Game State, but the Engine never reveals 100% of the Game State. That is, the actual Game State is often partially obscured to the players and GM, who need to actively probe (Explore!) using Techniques to suss out what's in there.<br/><br/>In taking part in this Exploration, each participant constructs their own version of the Game State in their head. Call this Shared Imagined Space (SIS). <br/><br/>The parts of the SIS that overlap among the people at the table is the Mutual Imagined Space (MIS), which is the group's shared understanding of the Game State.<br/><br/>One of the Techniques is a different color because I wanted to show that some might be "privileged" or special. The one on the left could be a GM-only technique that allows them to tinker with the rules of the Engine in a prescribed way.<br/><br/>Exploration is just the combination of the Engine and the Game State. In object-oriented-programming terms, Exploration is the class; Engine is the set of methods and static data known at compile time; Game State is the data used at run time (and stored between games to be reloaded before the next game, perhaps imperfectly).<br/><br/>You can also liken Game State to the Big Model's "Ephemera"--sorta.<br/><br/>The five elements of Exploration from the Big Model are necessarily in here (as pentagons), but I wasn't sure where they belong in this context, thus no arrows connecting them. My feeling is that they're all load data for the Engine, but that's still a work in progress in my head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486718/#Comment_486718" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-07-05T17:28:28+00:00" title="July  5, 2019  5:28PM">July 5</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd also like to argue that MIS isn't all that important.

The Game State is real. Knowing the Game State requires applying the Engine to get answers, and that is true for the players and the GM. <br/><br/>Even in non-blorb play, this is true. In Fiasco, there's a Game State, and the rules tell you have to turn the crank of the Engine to get more info about the Game State -- even if it just says that a player can make shit up on the fly...<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22159/my-preliminary-hypothesis" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22159/my-preliminary-hypothesis" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22159/my-preliminary-hypothesis/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F22159%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F22159%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
