The game is about a travel to the moon to plant and care about the flower. I got a somewhat melancholic feel from it and feel remembered of the anime Night on the Galactic Railroad. The second story game is <b>HORROR STORIES</b>, it\u2019s card based and maybe rather on the fringe what can be counted as a rpg. I think it\u2019s close enough to be included even if the cards are just used as story inspiration cards. If you are more into a good post apocalyptic setting you should check out <b>Pirates of a Shattered World</b>, that\u2019s if you like to spice up swashbuckling with quite some strange stuff. If you are more down for a traditional post-apo experience you might be more interested in <b>Scorched Earth</b>, which allows you to build the post apocalyptic world of your wishes. Now, if you are more interested into modern games and spies you should check out <b>The Spy Game</b> and <b>Super Secret Spy Agency</b> both are inspired by D&amp;D 5E. While Spy Games puts it into its name, the Spy Agency appears to highlight that it\u2019s suitable for two player (GM + player) games. Now you might be into some medieval low fantasy setting, where you\u2019ll find <b>Chivalry &amp; Sorcery</b> for the European spice and <b>Jordenheim</b> to have some viking flavor. I personally do like and backed the <b>Asphodel Complex</b>. Which is a modern day horror game, with really cool maps and apparently an easy system. For your dose of superheroes you might like to check <b>Hit the Streets</b>, which explore street level heroes like Jessica Jones and the other Defenders. Last but not least <b>L.O.R.E.</b> is a game that tries a more universal to generic approach, offering a tool box for various settings.<br/>There are as well many cool settings. Like <b>Trinity Continuum: Aberrant</b> by Onyx Path, which offers a fresh edition of the Aberrant of elderdays. My interest in <b>Pulp Fantastic</b> for Savage Worlds got spiked by the setting and <b>Fateforge</b> as well as <b>Fight or Flight</b> for D&amp;D 5E are just beautiful to look at.<br/>Of course there are many more interesting projects, just take a look:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>3 Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Low Fantasy Role-Playing Gams<br/>2 Post-Apocalyptic Role-Playing Gamea<br/>2 Spy Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Story Games Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Gamebook<br/>3 Settings<br/>4 D&amp;D 5E Settings<br/>2 Sourcebooks<br/>2 D&amp;D 5E Sourcebooks<br/>2 Adventures<br/>5 D&amp;D 5E Adventures<br/>6 Dice Projects<br/>1 Coin Projects<br/>4 Accessoires<br/>5 Enamel Pins<br/>1 Notebook<br/>1 Podcast<br/>1 Deck of Cards<br/>1 RPG Comic<br/>3 Maps Projects<br/>6 Various RPG Projects<br/>1 Skirmish Game<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/>1 Sourcebook<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/><b>Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/07/08/crowdfunding-collection-111/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2019/07/08/crowdfunding-collection-111/</a></b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
