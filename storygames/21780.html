I also wanted to add in volley rounds before the battle just like TOR.</p><p>TOR\u2019s table is that spears, 1 round and bows, 2 (or at loremaster\u2019s discretion more) rounds.</p><p>We want &amp; have deets so I made a longer table based on the formula that it\u2019s range divided by 60, <strong>rounded up</strong>. So spears are still one volley round, shortbows are two without disad (+ four with disad, for six total).</p><p>I gave my players a table for the weapons but also the formula b/c spells.</p><p>To find out how many volley rounds there are, we make an open roll on the encounter distance table (on the DM screen, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s in the books too) for that biotope. For example, it says Wasteland: 2d10 times 10 feet. I throw away the feet distance \u2013 I don\u2019t <em>want</em> to know exact feet distances, it trips me up \u2013 and read that line as: 2d10 divided by six volley rounds (rounded down as per usual, so there can be zero volley rounds sometimes).</p><p>The idea here is that it <strong>isn\u2019t</strong> an exact feet distance. I was getting feet distance questions a lot (for example from wizards wanting to know if their spells could reach). Now instead of a feet distance, we know that, for example, shatter works on the last round only and lightning bolt works on the last two rounds.</p><p>This, my hellish crusade against feet distances, has made me come around to the idea that 5e RAW perhaps wasn\u2019t as TotM-suited as I first thought. I love these house rules though\u2665. We are like a dozen or so sessions in with them, they work well. TOR reads as super stiff, formal, protocolized etc but decoupling the volley rounds and the back rank predicate into more of a freeform initiative has made everything fluid and fast.</p><p>It used to be that I had three kinds of fights: \u201cchase\u201d, \u201cvolley\u201d, and \u201cordinary fight\u201d. \u201cChase\u201d and \u201cvolley\u201d were the same thing: using paper &amp; pencil I\u2019d keep track of the feet distances carefully. In \u201cordinary fight\u201d, all questions of ranges and movement was just yes yes yes. Can I run up to them? Yes. Can my weapon reach them? Yes. Can they really run up to me I dashed? Yes. (And after a while I added \u201cinterception\u201d which ended up being exactly like 13th Age\u2019s rule \u2013 independently devised.)</p><p>And in the past, we had some people always wanting to head back. And it\u2019d mean that either I had to override the listed movement speeds of the tiny li\u2019l monsters in order to maintain the simplified, no-track-keeping \u201cordinary fight\u201d, or I had to roll up my sleeves and go to a full \u201cchase\u201d. And since some people \u201cI head back 60 feet\u201d <em>every fight</em> that became a chore.</p><p>The introduction of the back rank predicate from TOR has been a godsend\u2665\u2665\u2665</p><p>Now, when someone is like \u201cI walk back and use so-and-so ability to step backwards\u201d, I go \u201cOK, so your intent is to move further back than Ran, so she becomes front rank?\u201d. And then they can \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d on that.</p><p>The option of going to full \u201cchase\u201d is still there but we need to whip that out <em>much</em> seldomlier. If only one PC is fleeing or moving back or trying to kite, it becomes a manner of them trying to claim the back rank predicate.</p><p>And now, the volley rounds make it so that we have to whip out the full \u201cvolley\u201d rules seldomlier, too. (When separated by a ravine or something.)</p><p>Yesterday we had a fight where many of the participants could fly so this was awesome.</p><p>This is very much inspired by the beloved Targets in Areas of Effect table in the DMG.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>how many volley rounds are there: encounter distance roll but divide by 6 (round down) to find out number of rounds instead of multiply by 10 to find out distance in feet.</p><p>how many volley rounds does my weapon/spell work? range divide by 60 (rounded <strong>up</strong>).</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476359/#Comment_476359" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-24T03:08:10+00:00" title="August 24, 2018  3:08AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is good stuff, Sandra.

They tick down at the same rate if one side wants to close in as if both sides want to close in.</p><p>(The math behind the volley rounds is <em>based</em> on the idea that the groups get sixty feet closer each round, but the rule is only <em>based</em> on that, it then left that behind. So it\u2019s not \u201conly one side wants to close in that should mean half a tick or 30 feet\u201d or w/e. No way! Closing in \u306f closing in \u3060! If you\u2019re actively running <em>away</em> otoh then it\u2019s time for a chase. And\u2026 I haven\u2019t made chase rules yet but I might work on them today! Procrastinating from a big writing project!)</p>\nAnd "not ticking down" means that instead of the volley rounds going 3, 2, 1, m\xeal\xe9e it's 3, 3, 3, 3 etc. So only attacks usable on the third-last volley-round or sooner are usable.<br/><br/>I had to bring the group kicking and screaming into the idea that volley rounds are a <i>time</i> measurement rather than a distance measurement.
