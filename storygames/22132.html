I didn\u2019t realize that if the people who thought up <em>Red Riding Hood</em> had been aware of the implications, then they might never have written the story. This was at a time when I had no inspiration as a writer at all, but I didn\u2019t twig that the more I tried to understand the \u2018real\u2019 meaning, the less I wrote.</p></div></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485767/#Comment_485767" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-11T06:46:19+00:00" title="June 11, 2019  6:46AM">6:46AM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It\u2019s like asking the millipede how it walks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
