I couldn\u2019t take a close look at all projects, yet most of the projects look great.<br/>I personally backed the <b>The Next World</b> supplements for <b>Legacy: Life Among the Ruins</b>. Given my experience with the core book, I am really looking forward to getting those settings in print.<br/>Another project that caught my eye was <b>Domina Magica</b>. It\u2019s addressing the Magical Girl Anime genre and looked intruiging. Tough as a fan of horror games I do as well got an eye on <b>House of Keys</b>(a gm-less game) as well as <b>Era: The Chosen</b>.<br/>You might like to check the many science fiction tabletop games as well as the fantasy ones, or the others I haven\u2019t mentioned. It\u2019s quite an impressive collection. There are plenty more projects, though I will only briefly mention the <b>72 Lesser Key Solomon Demons coins</b>, which look amazing, and the French game <b>Meurtre</b> which might serv as an motivation to polish my French. Yet,\u2026 take a look for yourself:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>4 Role-Playing Games<br/>3 Horror Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Fantasy Role-Playing Games<br/>3 SF &amp; Cyberpunk Role-Playing Games<br/>3 SF-Fantasy Role-Playing Games<br/>8 Supplements<br/>3 D&amp;D Supplements<br/>1 Campaign<br/>4 Adventures<br/>5 D&amp;D Adventures<br/>8 Dice projects<br/>2 Coin projects<br/>4 Dice accessoires<br/>1 Enamel Pin<br/>3 Terrain &amp; Tiles<br/>2 RPG card decks<br/>2 RPG Apps &amp; Communities<br/>5 Various RPG Projects<br/>1 Other Game<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/><b>Portuguese Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Role-Playing Games<br/><br/>Link:<a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/08/21/crowdfunding-collection-82/" rel="nofollow"> https://teylen.blog/2018/08/21/crowdfunding-collection-82/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
