It\u2019s not the only problem with my proposal but that\u2019s a big one.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rafu" rel="nofollow">Rafu</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I\u2019d personally be much happier houseruling all damage to flat, fixed numbers, perhaps adjusted up or down for high or low margins on attack rolls.</p></div></blockquote><p>I can\u2019t change that much or it\u2019s no longer 5e; if I were to allow myself to make such changes I would\u2019ve made them even <i>more</i> radical. But, as a thought experiment of doing what you propose (make a change bigger than I <b>can</b> do but smaller than I\u2019d <b>want</b> to do) I\u2019d rather house rule away the to-hit-roll, since that\u2019s not really differentiated between classes, whereas damage is; fighters get more attacks, thieves get extra damage on sneak attack etc.</p><p>Like, if attacks are (unpredictably large) ticks on \u201cdeath clock\u201d until it\u2019s time to strike, why this two-step process? Why so many zero rounds? 0, 0, 8, 0, 12, 23, 24, 0, 0, 4, 23\u2026 so weird. And, if that\u2019s what I <i>wanted</i>, I could do that more easily by having a damage threshold; i.e.\xa0damage is counted as \u201cmax(0, roll-DT)\u201d. The <abbr title="\\">DT</abbr> could even be different for each pair of combatants, from some formula or table of defensive power vs offensive power. I don\u2019t know\u2026 or maybe I wouldn\u2019t make it a \u201cdeath clock\u201d mechanic at all, I\u2019d resolve fights in some other way completely. More akin to the War Machine system in the Rule Cyclopedia; take fortune at the end to its extreme: put a bunch a factors in (through a narrative &amp; interesting process full of description &amp; detail &amp; interaction back and forth between SIS and rules) and then one roll to see who lives or dies, and if the survivor is left with any wounds.</p><p>But\u2026 back to 5e:</p><p>Sorry to be such a mindless follower / misinterpreter of <a href="/forums/profile/lumpley">@lumpley</a> but\u2026 I think the solution might be to find out better mappings of \u201cdice\u201d events to \u201ccloud\u201d events, and I\u2019m hopeful since I stumbled on the idea of providing a \u201cdo you kill her?\u201d prompt outside the normal turn order.</p><p>If we could find semantics for the \u201chits\u201d vs \u201cmisses\u201d that isn\u2019t wounding/killing; such as \u201cstaggered\u201d, \u201cshocked\u201d, etc\u2026 uh\u2026 I\u2019m not good at coming up with good things. Not to add rules consequences to those semantics beyond what\u2019s currently there: <abbr title="hit point">HP</abbr> loss.</p><p>Yeah, that\u2019s what this is\u2026 me trying to keep the game\u2019s original mechanics but changing the mapping between \u2018dice\u2019 and \u2018cloud\u2019. Not sure I\u2019m doing a great job\u2026</p><p>to start over; and unmap everything\u2026 here is the components we have here by the drawing board.</p><h2 id="dice-events">Dice events</h2><ul><li>Spending actions</li><li>Making attacks</li><li>Making many attacks (fighter)</li><li>Making attacks with high damage (rogue)</li><li>Rolling under the enemy\u2019s AC</li><li>Rolling high or low damage</li><li>Rolling a natural 20</li><li>Enemy dies</li><li>Self dies</li></ul><h2 id="cloud-events">Cloud events</h2><ul><li>Time passes</li><li>Making attacks</li><li>Making many attacks (fighter)</li><li>Making focused and \u201cparticular\u201d attacks (rogue)</li><li>Enemy is unfazed</li><li>Enemy is rattled</li><li>Enemy is wounded</li><li>Enemy dies</li><li>Self is wounded</li><li>Self dies</li></ul><h2 id="overloaded-troublesome-words">Overloaded / troublesome words</h2><ul><li>Hit</li><li>Miss</li><li>Damage</li></ul><p>I haven\u2019t pitched my \u201cOh, Injury!\u201d suggestion (posted above) to the group yet; and next session is probably going to be on on Saturday (our scheduled main day is Tuesday the 14th but we were talking about putting in some extra sessions on Saturday and Monday). So we still have some time to fix this.</p><p>The introduction of a new \u201cprompt\u201d seems great; such prompts are great tools for more control over the granularity (whether we want to tune it to be finer or coarser) of the mapping without messing with the turn order. The equivalent of \u201chow do you want to do this?\u201d in Critical Role. The introduction of a wound threshold, if I end up going that direction, is a bigger intrusion, especially with the Fate inspired \u201cone time use of advantage\u201d idea.</p><p>We can see right away that what we have in those two lists, \u201cDice events\u201d and \u201cCloud events\u201d, don\u2019t map up well;<br/>it\u2019s difficult to describe the dice events in a clear and interesting way and that isn\u2019t inconsistent from player to player.</p><p>Ideally I\u2019d want a carrot (how about a translucent dangling carrot) that affords/conveys a good mapping; the \u201cwound\u201d prompt bonus (adv/disadv) was my first attempt at that.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be the mapping that I originally proposed, it just has to be a mapping (of the existing mechanics, we can\u2019t stop playing D&amp;D in the middle of the campaign) to something that does make more <em>sense</em> in the SIS.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482989/#Comment_482989" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-07T06:26:22+00:00" title="May  7, 2019  6:26AM">May 7</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/482963/#Comment_482963" rel="nofollow">Oh, Injury!</a> and Rafu's response.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482990/#Comment_482990" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-07T06:28:15+00:00" title="May  7, 2019  6:28AM">May 7</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2019 7:09AM by 2097.">edited May 7</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Reading the relevant chapter in Anima Prime rn.

The real work for me seems to lie there :<br/>- the words you must make do with : Hit, Miss, Damage.

All that is not "hit, miss, damage,  apply effect", is bond to be maneuvering. It is fluff in a way, but no less important, because it is also fictional positioning. It is also a place for player mastery.

That is totally what a "generic system" would do. That means one more number prepared on the sheet. <br/>With this abstraction in place, only in applying the effect would the nature of the attack matter. So that naming the proper effect (I chop him with my axe, pound her with my club, freeze it with my ray, etc.) could be enough to communicate the time when the player wishes to apply the effect. <br/><br/>I don't know about D&amp;D mechanics, maneuvering may not be as straight forward as piling up attacks. I suspect you need it because HP can go obscenely high. Maybe find a precedent in D&amp;D literature, maybe try with finer increments, maybe tolerate 3 misses before the player can't add anymore to the attack - so that missed rolls add to the dramaturgy of the fight. By all means, make the maneuvers benefit from teamwork. Maybe have a different system for ordinary skirmish and for boss fight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483007/#Comment_483007" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-07T22:14:47+00:00" title="May  7, 2019 10:14PM">May 7</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D has always had this weird confusion/duality about what hit points mean: on one hand, it's an abstract "death clock", but, at the same time, it's supposed to represent physical toughness (e.g. wizards and small creatures have fewer hit points). This means that hitting someone with a bigger knife causes more "damage", but hitting someone with a poisoned knife means they make a saving throw or suffer a condition.<br/><br/>That's always going to cause problems, in my opinion, when aiming for a consistent handling of how this maps to the fiction. (As you point out yourself, the to-hit roll doesn't necessarily mean that anyone was hit or missed - a "miss" could be a strike that "didn't matter", especially when it missed because of heavy armour being worn, and a "hit" could be a missed blow that caused them to lose their balance... and the same goes for a damage roll - it could mean anything, with a rolled "1" killing your opponent and a rolled "32" just rattling them for a moment.)<br/><br/>One issue with your approach here is that there are, quite simply, fewer "blows landing" in this new revised vision of D&amp;D combat. Most D&amp;D groups take the opposite approach, where each successful attack roll IS some kind of strike that lands, making D&amp;D combat much more like a superhero fight than like a lightsaber duel. It seems that you're going for the latter, instead.<br/><br/>That means that all your enemies will feel like swift, skilled, hard-to-hit combatants, instead of like "tanks", and that doesn't always match what the game is trying to represent or recreate. That could be bad for drama, as well - I think of Boromir's death scene in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, for example: that kind of moment would never happen under this interpretation of the rules.<br/><br/>Since I know you watch <i>Critical Role</i>, I think it's a good example of what a "every blow lands" interpretation of D&amp;D looks like. Sometimes the mounting injuries can get a little unrealistic, but it's dramatic and memorable, as well.<br/><br/>What, in your mind, is the main drawback of this more "typical" interpretation of "mounting injuries"?<br/><br/>Another potential issue is a stance mismatch - for me, for instance, I wouldn't enjoy casting fireball and then choosing which three enemies die. It's anti-gloracular (to use your favourite term <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> ), choosing instead of finding out.<br/><br/>I really like the "wound threshold + temporary condition" effect; that's nice. It will give the players another advantage in fights, though, as you suggest. But that's a nice effect, and gives some depth to gameplay and the imagined fiction, which I dig.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483014/#Comment_483014" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-08T05:12:34+00:00" title="May  8, 2019  5:12AM">May 8</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>What, in your mind, is the main drawback of this more \u201ctypical\u201d interpretation of \u201cmounting injuries\u201d?</p></div></blockquote><p>I don\u2019t like that specific kind of violence; the bloody stab after bloody stab kind.

Yeah, we\u2019re on the same page. (And I\u2019ll come back to fix those quotes, thanks and sorry!) In the case of my suggested rule, not spending HP means you\u2019re hit and you die, so you\u2019d never WANT to do that; it happens only once you\u2019re outmaneuvered.<br/><br/> The tiny tiny tiny issue I\u2019m describing with these rules here is just what they used to call an IIEE thing back at the Forge - where does the dice roll happen relative to narration?<br/><br/>I\u2019d have to train myself not to fully imagine the action my character is taking until after I\u2019ve rolled to hit and damage, right? Not a huge deal at all, but just slightly different than all the more \u201cFortune at the End\u201d rules in D&amp;D. <br/><br/>Or am I misunderstanding? It seems to me that I go \u201cI roll to hit\u201d, then roll damage, and the GM informs me that I hit well enough to wound, so NOW I decide that I\u2019m chopping its leg. <br/><br/>D&amp;D has other rules that work this way, too, and sometimes I might have been imagining the swing just the way I wanted before I rolled, anyway. So it\u2019s not a big deal at all. However, all of these rules for ammo expenditure and such tend to shift this dynamic in this very subtle way.<br/><br/>In comparison, other games with the \u201cmaneuver-maneuver-maneuver-strike\u201d tend to have you decide WHEN you want to go for the strike before rolling the dice. That feels more like the character\u2019s perspective to me, although admittedly it\u2019s hardly that different. The other approach is to have the defender tell you whether you hit them or not (like in Dogs in the Vineyard), which is smooth and cool, and that\u2019s what I was borrowing for my optional rule. (In this case I ALWAYS imagine my character swinging to kill, and the defender tells me if my blow lands or not, based on their remaining ability to get out of the way.)<br/><br/>I very much agree with your critique of FATE; it\u2019s a similar subtle thing which might not matter to some people but could make a difference to others. This thread has made me realize why I also feel a little funny about the \u201cshields be splintered\u201d rules sometimes, so thank you for that!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483032/#Comment_483032" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-08T18:06:29+00:00" title="May  8, 2019  6:06PM">May 8</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Or am I misunderstanding?

The damage (measured in points) tells us how hard it is to avoid.<br/><br/>The defender now must decide what to do. They have to spend hit points if they don't want to die. <br/><br/>The way they spend them determines what happens in the fiction - they get hit but avoid most of the damage, they block/parry, or they daintily step out of the way. <br/><br/>This is my favourite part: tremendous clarity! We know exactly what to imagine and how that impacts the strategy and the fiction for the next move. <br/><br/>You say, "I swing at your head! 2 damage!". I say, "Ha! Easy. I spend 4 points, ducking and stepping to the side - I have advantage on my next attack now." <br/><br/>But later in the fight, , you roll better (and I have few hit points left), so you say, "I swing at your head again, but this time I've got the measure of you! 12 damage!" <br/><br/>That's bad for me - I only have 8 hit points left, so I can't block or avoid. But I can say, "I'll spend half that to take a minor injury - you leave a bleeding gash across my neck that will need tending later, and now I'm off-balance, at disadvantage, as I give ground." (All those things get interesting - if I'm at the edge of a cliff, maybe it means I fall off, hoping the fall won't kill me as surely as your sword. Or if your sword had some magic ability or poison, that would have been the wrong choice - it's a "soul stealing" sword, so it touching me activates that power, for instance.)<br/><br/>But even if I don't fall off a cliff or have my soul sucked out, I'm in trouble - I only have 4 points left, so the next time you attack me for 8 or more points, I'm dead. This time you'll chop my head off (or whatever 0 hp means at our particular table).<br/><br/>Does that help?\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>Do you determine the desired, uh, target-area before you swing, then swing against it, then you either whiff or ping with the roll vs AC, and then if you do connect they can still parry/dodge by paying HP?</p><p>There\u2019s still some weird tautology in there that I haven\u2019t really sorted out.</p></div></blockquote>\nOh, I think you have - it's right here, below. (But the target area doesn't matter - it's just colour, since this is D&amp;D. But we can chat about for fun fight choreography - "I swing at you, for 8 points!" - "Ooh, I think I can block that. Are you swinging down low, or coming down from above, like this?")<br/><br/>Anyway, the weirdness:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I don\u2019t really see the point of empty \u201cpacing\u201d rounds.</p></div></blockquote>\nD&amp;D has this weird thing built-in where rolling to hit and rolling to damage is pretty redundant. So when you and I try to monkey with the process, it comes to the forefront: why are we bothering with a procedure which tends to create pointless/eventless empty "pacing" rounds?<br/><br/>It has to do with hit points serving double duty as a pacing mechanic and as "meat points" (representing physical injury). Ugh.<br/><br/>I think a good modern game shouldn't have that issue, but if we're working with D&amp;D, we have to grapple with that. In both mine and your alternate suggested rules, we get this redundancy and some pointless rolling, because of the underlying D&amp;D chassis.<br/><br/>You remember my "resist harm" move for Dungeon World? The idea was to have the same dynamic but without needing damage numbers for the attack - the idea is that it would be a similar dynamic, but with just a declaration of the attack/damage and then the roll/spend. (I never got to try it in a real game, though.)\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I\u2019d do something like you roll 4dF too see if you hit. If you did and rolled a ++++ you kill them, otherwise you inflict one wound for each blank (meaning that the fewer plusses you need to hit the higher the chance to succeed with blanks) and wounds are always both diegetic&amp;mechanic with a list of wound options for specific weapons. But then I remember the point of HP in D&amp;D, which is that fate (we have no fate but the fate is given us), verily, sheer <em>legend</em> protects you. (The figher \u2192 hero \u2192 superhero progression in D&amp;D\u2019s predecessors.) If I remove HP you can just get ganked out of the blue and that\u2019s not good!</p></div></blockquote>\nYeah! I like that with the Fudge dice - elegant. But you'd still have pacing rounds when you missed, wouldn't you? Probably best in an opposed-roll-winner-hits-loser kind of setup.<br/><br/>As for HP preventing you from being immediately ganked, that's true, but there are many other ways to do it! I got into a discussion with Vincent Baker once about how Apocalypse World needed to have hit points to give the PCs a "free hit" before they went down. So I designed a hit point-less system which still preserves that effect:<br/><br/><a href="http://ihousenews.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/63408904/Apocalypse%20harm.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ihousenews.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/63408904/Apocalypse harm.pdf</a>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I feel threatened by Cary for the position of \u201cworld\u2019s best DM\u201d.

Our game got to where it is doing the same thing.  To be honest it's still under "development" right now.  FREX - as the west coast group has played long enough that a fair number of players have a fair number of high level characters in our folders the DM is concerned that these high level characters have it too easy.  He didn't have any data points before, but now...<br/><br/>The one thing he doesn't seem to take into account, because he hasn't played in about 20 or so years, is that when a high level character commits to combat the stakes for the player are way higher than with a low level character.  It can take a decade or more or play to get to 10th level.  That's a lot of emotional investment.  My high level character might be more effective in combat on the whole but there are always those lurking "1's" and arrows are the great levelers.  Arrows (and knives) by pass stamina and do straight PBP which means a high level character is just as vulnerable as a low level character when hit by such weapons.  Granted a high level character is harder to hit but being hit by such a weapon is just as deadly to either high or low level character - except with the high level character we as players have 10+ years of real world time riding on the line.

The idea is that while Stamina goes up with level PBP is the character's physicality which does not change.<br/><br/>If I recall the story properly the DM wanted to make certain events deadly and scary for the players no matter how good their character is.  Arrows are LETHAL.  Knife fights are LETHAL.  Fall off a cliff, don't care if you are 1st or 20th level those rocks below are going to be LETHAL.<br/><br/>EDIT - The cliff example was so that high level characters couldn't exploit the HP system and jump off a cliff, take a 100 HP's, dust themselves off and walk away thus avoiding something worse or just getting around an obstacle (the cliff) in a manner that clashed with how the Setting worked.<br/><br/>That kind of stuff.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483280/#Comment_483280" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-12T21:47:32+00:00" title="May 12, 2019  9:47PM">May 12</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2019 10:37PM by Paul_T.">edited May 12</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, I see!

Mostly, I agree, though, if I'm understanding you correctly.<br/><br/>I'll throw out a few examples, anyway:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>Some bad things:</p><ul><li>I don\u2019t like the \u201chaha you miss easily\u201d double point spend; I want heroes and monsters to be competent; I want them to be able to feint &amp; be patient &amp; perceptive &amp; then\u2026 STRIKE!</li></ul></div></blockquote>\nMost of your issues and points here (both good and bad) really come down to how you narrate the actions, not the mechanics themselves. For instance, in this case it's not a problem if you simply describe it differently. It's not "haha you miss easily", it's "you do your best, but you just can't get past his guard. Moments later, the tempo has shifted, he's forcing you back on your heels, and you can tell you're now on the defensive. What are you going to do now?"<br/><br/>This can work the same way regardless of whether you're describing actual attacks or maneuvering, as I'll describe below.<br/><br/>When you say "I want heroes and monsters to be competent", unless you're talking about literally describing things that happen as being stupid or mistakes (which, you know - just don't do that!), I think you're making a logical error. There's no way to make both sides seem cool and competent at all times - one contradicts the other. Someone has to be better now and then, which makes their opponent seem less competent. This shows up in many of your examples, by the way!<br/><br/>For instance:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Also, when the players prematurely attack someone that has \u201cfirst strike\u201d on them, I need to start going:<br/><br/>\u201cI attack the Full Metal Frankenstein with my short sword!\u201d<br/>\u201cOh, he\u2019s definitely ready for you, Alice, swiping your sword to the side and pulling his fist back; you\u2019re staring right into his white knucks, what do you do?\u201d<br/><br/>(without the player even getting to make an attack roll, don\u2019t worry, my \u201ckeeping track of the action econ\u201d system will ensure that the player will get to make all the attacks [and other actions] that are due to them.)<br/><br/>Cary my hero\u2665\u2665\u2665<br/><br/>This is gonna be awesome</p></div></blockquote>\nThat's a cool narration, but definitely makes the PC look less-than-competent, right (at least by your definition)?<br/><br/>I've never had a problem with this, because it's the monster's competence which is highlighted, not the PC's incompetence. It's narrations like "you go to strike the beast, swing, and stick your sword into the ground" which make you feel like an idiot (and a lot of people do this when they play D&amp;D). On the other hand, "you come in swinging, quick as lightning, but the monster's even faster than you are!" just makes me feel like, "wow, this enemy is badass! Better rethink my strategy". I don't think that makes the "hobo" (your vocabulary is catchy!) look like a fool at all. <br/><br/>There is no way to make a monster seem really scary and intimidating without making the hobos seem a little less competent.<br/><br/>Another example:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>\u201cI\u2019m eying that Full Metal Frankenstein, trying to circle him\u201d<br/>\u201cIn the flickering light of Bob\u2019s lantern it\u2019s pretty clear to you, Alice, that he\u2019ll smash you to bits if you even come close; what do you do?\u201d<br/><br/>Exact same mechanical outcome: the player will have to defend before attacking [at the same numbers&amp;consequences]; but the second hobo comes across as as cool, calculating, controlled, where the first hobo came across as making a mistake.<br/><br/>Hold on, it\u2019s not the exact same mechanical outcome; it\u2019s better; because if Bob joins up and they go over there together and Bob has control over where the lantern shines, they can get in the first swing! (It\u2019s possible that they come up with that plan in either scenario <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23playerskill&amp;Mode=like">#playerskill</a> or it\u2019s possible that they even with the second narration don\u2019t come up with the plan, but the second narration makes it slightly more likely, rewarding them for \u201cmaneuvering\u201d.<br/><br/>That wasn\u2019t even me trying for that intentionally. That\u2019s just the life-changing magic of fictional positioning in the sis.</p></div></blockquote>\nIt's definitely better, agreed. The difference, though, has nothing to do with "attacking vs. maneuvering". It's two entirely unrelated things:<br/><br/>1. It's simple IIEE. In the first example, the player is forced to commit to their action before they know about the "first strike". In this second example, you tell her (I think you're talking to Alice!) about the "first strike" and <i>only then</i> ask her if she wants to reconsider her action. That's why she comes across like she's making a mistake in the first example, but not the second example - you're given her more information before she makes the decision (after the first "I" instead of the second "I", in other words).<br/><br/><small>It's kind of weird, because you're also then going to be giving them another action later (and the dice don't get rolled just yet), but either way, the <i>fictional</i> description has them committing to something while being unaware of an important piece of information.</small><br/><br/>2. The thing about the lantern light, similarly, has nothing to do with maneuvering vs. attacking. In the first example, you don't mention it at all. In the second, you explicitly say that it's the reason for the "first strike", giving the players a chance to attempt a strategy in reaction.<br/><br/>If I rewrite your example like so, you can see that it's your GMing that makes the difference, not what the rules are doing or how the player is announcing her action:\n<blockquote>\u201cI attack the Full Metal Frankenstein with my short sword!\u201d<br/>\u201cIn the flickering light of Bob\u2019s lantern it\u2019s pretty clear to you, Alice, that he\u2019ll smash you to bits if you even come close; are you sure that's what you want to do?\u201d</blockquote>\nSame thing - the player isn't making a mistake, and they can strategize about the lantern now, if they want.<br/><br/>Similarly:\n<blockquote>\u201cI\u2019m eying that Full Metal Frankenstein, trying to circle him\u201d<br/>\u201cOh, you circle him but he\u2019s definitely ready for you, Alice, swiping your sword to the side and pulling his fist back; you\u2019re staring right into his white knucks, what do you do?\u201d</blockquote>\nThe player is caught off-guard, their character made an error, and they know nothing about the lantern. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>In AW terms, you're making different MC moves. In the first case, it's all "tell them the consequences and ask", and in the second it's "announce future badness".                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483281/#Comment_483281" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-12T21:47:43+00:00" title="May 12, 2019  9:47PM">May 12</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2019 10:42PM by Paul_T.">edited May 12</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/></p>unless we have a co-DM, there\u2019s no way to find out what the monsters would choose</div></blockquote>\nYou're absolutely right! That's a challenge. I guess you could simplify the system for them (they always "choose" the same thing), and leave the choices to the players. But it sounds like you're going to leave the choices out altogether , so it's probably not an issue. I support that, for speed and simplicity! Good idea, most likely.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>Normal soul stealing swords in 5e worx like this:</p><p>if they crit against someone with 100 hp or less, they have to con save (dc 15) or die (unless they are construct or undead)</p></div></blockquote>\nThat's exactly the sort of contrived rule D&amp;D needs to have to get around the nature of abstract hit points (it's basically mandating that yes, you do get hit any time there's a critical, so long as you have fewer than 100 HP, which means the hit points no longer work as "death clock" under those exceptional circumstances, breaking down their purpose - and does this generalize to other attacks? No idea... no clarity). <br/><br/>Having a system like I'm describing, though, obviates the need for such complex rules! Now "I don't have enough hit points left to avoid the attack" is the only way you get soul-drained, and we no longer need a special case of a rule about critical rolls and how many HP you have left - it's a natural outcome of the basic system, instead. <br/><br/>What's even better is that it becomes a tactical consideration, making the game more interesting for the players: now it makes a big difference whether you know about the sword's abilities or not! You have to decide whether to risk having it touch you.  In regular D&amp;D, you have no choice to make; it's just about the d20 roll, which decides for you. You knowing that it exists or not basically doesn't change your combat options at all. <br/><br/>Under something like these rules, though, being more scared of the sword makes a dramatic difference, which I think is really cool. (Because I'll want to spend more HP to stay safe from it.) I benefit from my improved knowledge in a clearer and easier way.<br/><br/>Now you don't need any special rules for poison or soul-stealing any more: it's reflected in the way players spend their HP to avoid that attack! Very elegant. Much more elegant than "if they crit against someone with 100 hp or less, they have to con save (dc 15) or die (unless they are construct or undead)" - instead, it's "if the thing touches you, make a Con save (DC 15) or die", which is both more intuitive and more interesting, as well as easier to remember and adjudicate. (In "normal" D&amp;D, what the hell happens if you just let the attacker stab you with the soul-stealing sword, but they don't get to roll at all, or they roll but don't roll a crit, or a rule indicates that they hit automatically, for instance? Not obvious.)<br/><br/><small>(I mentioned this in the other thread, but in case it's been forgotten: I don't think the numbers I came up with, especially the 1/2 and x2, are actually right for this. It was just a proof of concept. Realistically it should be something more like [damage -1 per die to take a minor flesh wound/graze], [straight damage to block or parry], and [damage +1 per die to avoid the attack altogether]. But even that isn't right, because D&amp;D isn't consistent with how it determines damage - similar weapons could be rated 1d10+1 or 2d6, for example - and it depends on the edition being used. It would take some thinking. The idea is just that you spend more HP to avoid attacks you're particularly scared of - that's the basic principle - and can try to spend less when you're confident you're going to win, but you risk being overconfident and falling prey to poison, magical effects, losing ground or position, suffering disadvantage, or whatever else we want to highlight tactically.</small>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><ul><li>one of the things you\u2019re saying, Paul, is \u201cYou can choose to take an injury to halve the amount of HP you lose that round\u201d, this bings us back to splintered shields &amp; stress-track consequences, which we didn\u2019t really want, remember?

Here's a good "middle ground" between your rules and my proto-idea:<br/><br/>You no longer choose. Instead, if just happens when you go below your "wound limit" (or "fainting limit", or whatever you were calling it). You take a wound and if there was poison or soul-stealing or whatever, that's when it happens! <br/><br/>So:<br/><br/>* Someone attacks you or maneuvers for an opening (again, it doesn't matter). Describe the attack/maneuver and the amount of damage/threat points.<br/>* If you can spend that number of points, you've avoided the attack. You're safe, but you're getting tired/worn down (or whatever you think HP loss represents, if anything).<br/>* If you can spend that number of points, but it takes you below your "wound limit", you've been physically hit by the attack, but it's nothing too serious. It's a light wound/flesh wound/scratch/graze/minor non-lethal injury. [Apply poison/magical effects here, collect Inspiration, etc - and you could remove your "lingering injuries" rule here, since activating those effects could be sufficiently bad to encourage people to keep their "limit" low. But I like the idea that someone who often gets "bloodied" in combat and risks getting poisoned gets Inspiration!]<br/>* If you can't spend that many points, it's a mortal/lethal wound (use normal rules here).<br/>* A mortally wounded character has 0 HP, by definition (since they can't defend themselves).<br/> <br/>That's pretty elegant, I think! And it gives us that clarity I like. <br/><br/><small>Some fun stuff with this ruleset:<br/><br/>We can now have a "to first blood" duel in D&amp;D! That's nifty. (And risky, because, just like in real life, you can try all you want, but it's still possible you'll kill your opponent by accident.)<br/><br/>If you like the idea of being Wolverine - the guy who ends the battle with five arrows sticking out of him - you can give yourself a high wound limit and rake in the Inspiration!<br/><br/>If you want to incentivize high "wound limits" further: when a character with 0 HP is revived, wakes up, comes to consciousness, or whatever, they immediately go to their "wound limit". So, if my "wound limit" is 4 and yours is 1, if we both fall, wounded, but make our death saves and get back up, I get up with 4 HP and you get up with 1 HP. I kinda like that distinction!</small><br/><br/>What this really does is <i>move the decision point for when you get hit from the moment of combat all the way back to character creation</i>. (But gives us the advantage of simplicity and speed, in return.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483282/#Comment_483282" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-12T22:33:05+00:00" title="May 12, 2019 10:33PM">May 12</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>Yeah!

worry! I'm not annoyed or anything. I just got very confused by all the tangents and mixture of "current rules" with hypothesizing and so forth. I couldn't tell what was you explaining things and what was you suggesting possibilities and what was you pointing out issues with my suggestions. For instance, now I finally understand why you were talking about carrots and sticks - it's about player behaviour, not diegetics or game mechanics. Now I get it! It seems I was a bit dense. :P<br/><br/>Hilarious how I ended up sort of reproducing your system. Ha! Sorry about that.<br/><br/>I still find it odd that you're so concerned with the PCs "not looking dumb" but willing to use a "stick" when a player describes an attack. (I understand that it's the player, in the second case, who made the "error", not the character, but it's still the character who ends looking "dumb" or at least "slow" in the fiction - and, in my opinion, worse - dumber, in other words - than in the standard case of "the monster parried your attack".)<br/><br/>Anyway, it sounds like you've settled on something, so that's good.<br/><br/>I have a few minor comments, and then I'll leave it at that:<br/><br/>1. I think D&amp;D shoots itself in the foot with the way attacks, hit points, and special abilities all interface. It just roughly holds together in the "standard" interpretation (all hits are actual "hits" in the fiction - bam! pow!), which is kind of like a superhero fight: lots of brutal powers and attacks landing, but no one actually gets killed or seriously hurt (until the end, anyway). As you start to remap those things, the flaws and problems come out, as they are doing here.<br/><br/>If you use the "wound limit = hit, but not lethally" and "0 HP = lethally wounded" rules, the ideal solution would be to rewrite all those powers, spells, and effects so they interface with that.<br/><br/>Basically, casting a spell or breathing fire or any of those things threaten to finish the fight (just like swinging your sword), but someone with HP remaining can avoid that fate.<br/><br/>Therefore, any such ability or power should have a "damage". For instance, you cast Mind Control on your foe, it "does" "20 damage". Pay that many hit points, and you shrug it off.<br/><br/>However, each power also has an effect at "wounded" and another at "dead". Mind Control, perhaps, imposes disadvantage on everything you do until you make a saving throw (if it gets to your wound limit), or makes you a puppet of your opponent (at 0 HP). Stuff like that.<br/><br/>For weapons, it's "lingering injury" at the wound limit and "mortally wounded" at 0 HP. For other abilities and powers, it's "minor effect" and "full effect", for that ability.<br/><br/>So those attacks, as befits the "genre", can be fired off and get shrugged off, over and over, until the final one or two end the fight. (The "fainting buffer" gives the opponent a chance to surrender before they're done for good.)<br/><br/>2. I prefer my variation on the wound limit, where you can take multiple wounds. More dramatic and more interesting! Some people love to play Wolverine, and it adds cool tension to fights, too. (But it does depend on what rules you're using for those wounds; I'd be fine with them just being cosmetic, too.)<br/><br/>3. Interesting to see that "lingering wounds" table. I can't say I love it, but the minor risk of serious injury is at least potentially intriguing. The idea of gaining Inspiration just to spend <i>on the injury roll</i> itself is kind of lame, though, in my opinion. For anyone who has tokens piled up, it just means it drains their stockpile, for instance, and it has no effect on the fight itself. <br/><br/>Hard to pass up that 12.5%-ish chance difference on losing a limb! I don't know. Maybe you're already using it and it's working out great in play...<br/><br/>Also, isn't getting Inspiration part of the reason you'd want to have a high wound limit? In that case, it needs to be good for something other than avoiding the wound you've just signed up to suffer...<br/><br/>4. You occasionally use the acronym DSF - I have no idea what that is!<br/><br/>5. I like your technique of looking for diegetic responses to "incorrect declarations" as opposed to just saying it's "wrong". That's a smart thing to look for, and I understand what you're going for now.<br/><br/>6.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>These three things are the gateway between \u201chealthy&amp;safe\u201d vs \u201chere sits a bloody mess\u201d:</p><ul><li>HP (\u201cdeath clock\u201d a.k.a. \u201cmaneuver points\u201d; spend these to negate attacks or survive manuvers)</li><li>AC/DC (succeed on rolls and you might not even have to spend points)</li><li>action econ (act out of turn and you might not even get to roll)</li></ul></div></blockquote>\nThis is very insightful! A good analysis.<br/><br/>7. Overall, I like a lot of this, but the "roll to maneuver" business sounds like it would be awkward and un-fun to me. Of course, I'd have to try it, and maybe some people will love it, but that's my hunch. For instance, some things that could feel funny:<br/><br/>For starters, now instead of "rolling to swing a sword at your enemy" you're "rolling to get the GM to tell you that you get to hurt the monster now". Killing the monster is cool and all, but "well done, you get to hurt the monster now, just not kill it" feels a little like a "mother may I" interaction. <br/><br/>The timing of dice and rolls seems to place the suspense/tension and the fictional causes in the wrong places sometimes.<br/><br/>For example, I've never seen an action movie where the Orcs draw their bows, point them at one enemy, then see they can't get a shot, so they point them at another enemy, and repeat. Are they just standing there, aiming (and could be for many rounds)? No, we've got arrows flying and bouncing of peoples' shields and everyone is screaming! <br/><br/>Same thing when two swordsmen are fighting - all those blows are potentially killing ones, they just can't get through defenses. <br/><br/>It's no different in "calmer" fiction (e.g. Tolkien's fight/battle scenes, at the opposite extreme of the spectrum from an action flick).<br/><br/>(Sidenote: perhaps it would work well if there were different *types* of maneuvers which matteres - maneuvering for position vs. trying to drive your opponent back, stuff like that.)<br/><br/>As another example, this is weird:<br/><br/>"The Orcs draw their bows but don't fire yet. 14 damage, including the poison you can see. Roll a Con save."<br/>-&gt; Strange that PC knows about the poison already (dramatically speaking, a wasted opportunity - no suspense or uncertainty; similarly, it's knowledge that would normally affect future decisions - am I worried about the poison - but, instead, it's already in the past mechanically even though nothing has happened yet diegetically).<br/>-&gt; Strange that the PC now makes a Con save - what does this even represent? They're feeling super healthy today, so now they're not as scared of the arrows... even though they haven't even left the bows yet? On a failure, they have a... future sense that the poison will be bad for them if the Orcs do fire?<br/><br/>And what if I'm a 'berserker' raging into battle, or a desperate warrior trying to save their dying child, acting all irrational? Or I'm fighting a horde of zombies or a swarm of bees? Or trying desperately to swing at an invisible foe? Surely none of those are going to be all "here I am, maneuvering, trying to line up the perfect shot"?<br/><br/>None of it is terrible or game-breaking, but a lot of the details sound strained and odd to me. Overall, not convinced it's better than D&amp;D as-is (with all the awkwardness that has).<br/><br/>Definitely worth trying and reporting back on, however! It's been a pretty fascinating conversation and I think it's great stuff to be thinking about and experimenting with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483347/#Comment_483347" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-13T22:26:00+00:00" title="May 13, 2019 10:26PM">May 13</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2019 10:26PM by 2097.">edited May 13</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I still find it odd that you\u2019re so concerned with the PCs \u201cnot looking dumb\u201d but willing to use a \u201cstick\u201d when a player describes an attack.

But my prediction that the system "needs" the other description (<b>IIEE, teeth etc</b>) still held up; the only skippable line is ironically the last one, the killing blow, and I just had to be disciplined to do those.<br/><br/>In one of the fights the hobos had trapped some gargoyles using a spell so that they <b>couldn't do anything</b>. And I was like "ok you can just kill them scratch some arrows" and then one player got confused and I said "OK we'll just roll it out yahtzee style"; when the monster's can't make moves there's no need for description.<br/><br/>But then later we had a more detailed fight again because, uh, not to keep on harping but the system really does force the description out (in order to select between the diegetically different but dice-level-equal monster moves). <b>It's just a not fun to describe the same types of hits and moves over and over again</b>. I use my shield ok you block its mouth with your shield etc.<br/><br/>An interesting side effect is that the increased focus on the diegetics lead to all of us <b>remembering to do all kinds of other moves</b> like shove, grapple etc. The room's features, balconies, ledges, bottomless slime pits etc all mattered way more as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483643/#Comment_483643" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-17T19:59:15+00:00" title="May 17, 2019  7:59PM">May 17</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dogs, that part of Dogs I could never get to work well.

Because if HP is spent to effectively "avoid" the blow, how does the ghoul's nasty poison paralyse the hobos? I suppose you could say "the claws just barely scratch your arm as you duck out of the way, make a CON check..." but this seems like a bit of an annoying exception.

You want the INTENT to be the same, but for the TIBF to trigger an EXECUTION change, that leads to a different EFFECT in the SiS.<br/><br/>So this generally takes the form of the TIBF exerting pressure on the EXECUTION that causes the EFFECT to be a failure.<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>I want to pick the lock (INTENT) but my lover is in danger (TIBF: Lover in danger), so my hands are shaking and sweaty (EXECUTION) which leads to failure (EFFECT)<br/><br/>So in your insp rules you say not to do this but I would add an extra way to trigger TIBF effects on the INTENT level. This might be to radical or messy though, consider it food for thought.<br/><br/>The framing is as follows.<br/><br/>Your character WANTS to succeed at adventure stuff but, they also have other things (trait things) they want to succeed at. When you \u2018take a dive\u2019 on adventure stuff to succeed at a trait thing INSTEAD, gain insp.<br/><br/>Examples: <br/><br/>GEEZER the old man has a TIBF \u2018things were better in my day\u2019. He goes to search the wall, which takes ten minutes. (That\u2019s the adventure goal). The player decides to trigger the TIBF to get insp. He half heartedly searches the room while rambling on about his day. He fails to search properly but makes damn sure that everyone listening knows about how much better things were in his day.<br/><br/>Rogue with TIBF \u2018member of oppressed class\u2019. He goes to pick the lock. Decides to trigger his TIBF instead. Smashes the lock out of anger and screams about the injustice of it all. (His INTENT has changed to inform everyone of injustice at the cost of picking the lock).<br/><br/>So just to reiterate. We\u2019re conceptualising a TIBF dive as a value conflict. The prime value is the one associated with the quest/goal. The \u2018failure\u2019 isn\u2019t so much a failure as another value (TIBF) taking priority over the quest/goal, that causes disruption to the quest goal.<br/><br/>Anyway I hope that makes sense, when I did use TIBF type stuff in my games that\u2019s how I did it. In fact I\u2019d often make a character with a prime goal (restore the rightful king) then spike him by adding TIBF stuff that would fuck with that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484026/#Comment_484026" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-22T15:14:23+00:00" title="May 22, 2019  3:14PM">May 22</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if, instead of automatically failing at the task, the player rolls with disadvantage?<br/><br/>That way, it becomes a kind of trade-off: roll with disadvantage now so you can roll with advantage later on. <br/><br/>Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484027/#Comment_484027" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-22T15:21:43+00:00" title="May 22, 2019  3:21PM">May 22</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">@Trent_W</a>  that's def an interesting idea!

They\u2019d be as follows.<br/><br/>The basic principle is \u2018when one TIBF interferes with another TIBF, gain insp\u2019. All actual mechanics would be ways of implementing that.<br/><br/>For this to work, everything a character does must in pursuit of a TIBF. This doesn\u2019t need to be super strict, you just need a general understanding that your character is on a given quest because of a TIBF.<br/><br/>So in a general sense it would work like this.<br/><br/>My thief has \u2018get stinking rich\u2019 and \u2018cowardly\u2019.<br/><br/>I\u2019m exploring a dungeon to get gold (stinking rich) but I hear a weird noise, could be danger, I fling my lantern on the floor and run screaming (cowardly)<br/><br/>When I\u2019m about to roll the dice to do something.

(which counts as failing the roll and gets me insp).<br/><br/>What this system \u2018might\u2019 have issues with is the following:<br/><br/>I fail to pick the lock because my hands are shaking because \u2018I\u2019m a coward.\u2019 <br/><br/>I\u2019m halfway up the wall when I fall because \u2018I have a deformed arm.\u2019                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484036/#Comment_484036" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-22T19:02:49+00:00" title="May 22, 2019  7:02PM">May 22</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" rel="nofollow">Trent_W</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> just speaking from the standpoint of D&amp;D player psychology here, they're going to be a lot more likely to voluntarily drop the flashlight if that means rolling with a penalty vs automatically failing.</p></div></blockquote>\nOh I'm not disputing that!

Partly I think it might be too <i>easy</i> to set up a pair of traits specifically designed to exploit this. <small>\u2190 cue standard \u201coh i wouldn\u2019t play with cheaters anyway\u201d spiel</small></p><p>For me, the specific design challenge I have right now is <b>making the mechanic character-facing rather than author-facing</b>.</p><p><a href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">@Trent_W</a> \u2019s suggestion made the mechanic milder but didn\u2019t really change this issue.</p><p>Alexander\u2019s suggestion made the mechanic apply to fewer cases; and the way he phrases his <b>diegetic examples</b> make them seem character facing, <i>buuut</i> the challenge of creating a character-facing \u201cdiegesis\u2194dice\u201d <b>mapping</b> remains. (That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they have to <i>start</i> on the diegetic level; as <a href="/forums/profile/lumpley">@lumpley</a> clarified playing fiction first doesn\u2019t mean you have to play as if you were unaware of your own moves or your own stats. So for example the fighter\u2019s \u201cSecond Wind\u201d ability is a dice-level ability but can still be character facing; a character might decide she needs to focus her breath for a second.)</p><p>And if that challenge is solved, then Alexander\u2019s or Trent\u2019s suggestions might be unnecessary, or they might be the absolute gravy that makes the mechanic fly even higher.</p><p>Sorta like the first mapping issue I had in this thread; the \u201cwound threshold\u201d/\u201cwounding time\u201d thing that I thought would make the diegesis\u2194dice thing fly hasn\u2019t really helped at all and I\u2019ve been thinking about dropping it, while Paul\u2019s idea of turning HP from lose to spend has been an absolute cornerstone.</p><p>Basically I think what needs to happen is that the traits need to become almost like abilities that you can use. Peeps been reporting good success with the keys in The Shadow of Yesterday, right? I obv don\u2019t want the 1/2/5 granularity but I want to figure out why/how people have made them work. They\u2019re even phrased \u201cYour character loves wealth\u201d instead of \u201cyou love wealth\u201d and still they\u2019ve worked for some peeps.</p><p>Here\u2019s an example trait from the PHB \u201cFlattery is my preferred trick for getting what I want.\u201d [Yes, write-your-own traits are cooler, I get that, especially the bonds. But in my experience some people <em>love</em> rolling up random traits from the book. IDK why but they really do.]</p><p>While I (for a paper-based quick character generator I used for a con game) illegally typed in every single background from the PHB into TeX back in July 2015, (yes yes I know, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23manic2097&amp;Mode=like">#manic2097</a> ), I can\u2019t easily rephrase them all and expect everyone I ever play with to have a character using these rather than from the book. Or idk, maybe.</p><p>So ideally I want a universal way to, uh, mechanize these using the move &amp; \u201cdiegetic ludeme\u201d tech we\u2019ve got going here. Like, some might look misleadingly easy: \u201cI\u2019m a born gambler who can\u2019t resist taking a risk for a potential payoff.\u201d</p><p>So the ultimate goal of this is so that DM don\u2019t have to memorize all of the players\u2019 stuff all the time! I want the characters to, through diegetical action/inaction in a way that is noticable to everyone at the table, can get insp, just like how the Second Wind fighter ability can give you HP or the Action Surge ability can give you action econ. I\u2019m especially looking at <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/inspiration#taking-a-dive" rel="nofollow">the category of insp that I\u2019ve called \u201ctaking a dive\u201d</a>. Obviously no one wants to take a dive! That was a stupid way to write it up. Since I wrote the rules that way, no-one has ever went for that dive insp. (They\u2019ve still been playing their character true to the traits though; they\u2019re just not claiming insp for it. But then later being like \u201cwhy don\u2019t we have more insp\u201d. Which, understandable, not blaming them, my rules are at fault here.) (Yes, the keys in The Shadow of Yesterday also have some of what I called \u201cquest inspiration\u201d in there.)</p><p>We had a lot of insp at our table because I knew the characters well (not necessarily studying their traits list but being able to think \u201cok, no normal munchkinhobo would\u2019ve ever done that, that has to be a character thing\u201d) and so I\u2019d go \u201cIt seems like there just was a spontaneous Hillfolk scene, or there just was someone giving in to their trait, here have some insp\u201d and trying to move to a more player-initiated take on insp hasn\u2019t worked out yet [granted, it\u2019s only been <strong>three</strong> sessions, all of which <em>also</em> had this remarkable new fighting system and an elaborate &amp; blorby heist being pulled off].</p><p><small>(The reason for my \u039b\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7-like withholding of insp is again to not have to learn all their stuff and also because I had gotten somewhat sloppy like \u201coh you reminded me of a rule that I have forgotten but the rule is gonna kill you but you said it anyway? here have some insp\u201d. Which, OK, either I change the rules to include that kinda stuff or I don\u2019t do that kinda stuff.)</small></p><p>So part of what made the HP spending thing have such dramatic results right away was, just as Paul predicted:</p><p>you initiate a hard af move (inflicting death or serious pain) diegetically, and the only way to be able to negate it is to either make the defense roll or spend the HP. It\u2019s a mechanic you <em>have</em> to engage with <em>or else you die</em>. My insp rules as currently written are the opposite of that. If you <em>do</em> engage with them, it sucks. You drop a rope or whatever.</p><p>I need to find the perfect, uh, \u201cteeth\u201d for these mechanics.</p><p>OK, kinda typing-as-I-think here, but\u2026 extending the Hillfolk dramatic tokens to procedural.</p><p>The semantics I want is that \u201cIf someone gives into you\u201d you give them insp, from the bank if you have none. Wait, that\u2019s backwards. I don\u2019t want \u201csomeone\u201d doing things, I want <em>you</em> doing things. \u201cIf you win an argument\u201d you have to pay them insp (from the bank if you have none). OK, better, but it\u2019s not always arguments it can also be things like validation, acknowledgement, trust etc. Also the \u201cif/when\u201d trigger stuff is great for things that the DM can be arsed to care about but not as good for things that are player initiatated. [Yes, a lot of PbtA moves are phrased that way but I don\u2019t think they work that well.]</p><p>Guh working on the socks darned fighting rules took two weeks and now I\u2019ve immediately jumped into another challenge why do I do this to myself <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/></p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484049/#Comment_484049" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-23T05:49:44+00:00" title="May 23, 2019  5:49AM">May 23</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2019 5:51AM by 2097.">edited May 23</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a> tying them into leveling up is great.

Very cute! Covered it here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/484181/#Comment_484181" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/484181/#Comment_484181</a><br/><br/>However, it's relevant to this thread because I was watching it, and now I can't watch anyone play D&amp;D without thinking about the conversational flow of combat.<br/><br/>We can see how, with Mercer's attention to narrative detail, D&amp;D combat is always fictionally vivid and constantly evolving. I think this is what you were talking about earlier, Sandra, that I wasn't getting: when you go from "Yahtzee combat" to colourful description, suddenly more variety in combat takes place, because individual descriptions inspire new "moves" and ideas of things to try. (Mercer arguably overdoes this in the adventure, when he describes the panther's attack as knocking Colbert's character prone, but fortunately that never becomes important mechanically.) I didn't catch that at all earlier, because I didn't realize Sandra was coming from "Yahtzee combat", and therefore didn't understand why it would make a difference. I think that, on the surface, the descriptions here are probably quite similar to what you're doing now, right, Sandra (in terms fictional detail and flow)?<br/><br/>However, I was also thinking the whole time about <i>how much better</i> and easier that would be if we had players rolling all the dice (the defense roll, as in PbtA games, based on a player's announced action in response) and if the "HP spending" metaphor was also being employed. That would make maintaining the discipline of this kind of narration much more natural (and easier not to forget).<br/><br/>This reminds me of two somewhat unrelated thoughts:<br/><br/>1. If I were to do this, I would want to rename hit points, probably. I'd want a term that says "last minute ass saving points" somehow, and then feats and abilities and tags could give us stuff to say with those. (A wizard with a magical aura of protection could narrate bursts of light turning away blows, for instance. You could think of that as adding "moves" to the PC's sheet; when you spend HP, you pick one of them.)<br/><br/>What term might work to replace HP? I can't think of any good word/phrase off the top of my head. <br/><br/>2. Also, for my tastes, I'd want to make more of a distinction between "successful defense roll" and "HP spend". I know that the flexibility of description is a nice feature, but it would also make it more "blorby" if there was a narrative constraint on the two (sometimes description matters, after all), as well as inspiring different/new narration.<br/><br/>This would also help on the GM's side, because it's unfortunate if when I'm hitting all my rolls against the Ogre the combat doesn't <i>feel</i> any different than if I was missing all of them.<br/><br/>(In other words, I'd use "successful defense" for "snatched the arrow out of the air", but the Desperation Point/HP spend would be a graze or a close call. One is a confident defense; the other is a desperately close call, barely avoided.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484198/#Comment_484198" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-25T06:45:41+00:00" title="May 25, 2019  6:45AM">May 25</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Before I start reading more carefully to write a more detailed answer (and also I need to look at that hour long video first and I hate watching TV so that's gonna be a challenge for me) I happened to see at a glance that you mentioned panthers knocking characters prone; <a href="https://open5e.com/monsters/miscellaneous-creatures/panther.html" rel="nofollow">that's a special ability that panthers have</a>.

I take ABT seriously and the current iteration still deserves more testing. Maybe I\u2019ll eat crow in a few months when I\u2019ve changed to something more akin to what you and Paul are suggesting now, but that\u2019s then. We only play twice a week so I don\u2019t have infinity time testing.

Interesting. (Really not a fan of this kind of D&amp;D-ism... getting knocked prone should be an effect of some kind of game maneuver or "physics" principle, not a "special ability" reserved for certain species... but I suppose it could have inspired Mercer here! There was no Strength save, but he could have been thinking about that ability at some level, true.)<br/><br/>I went back and reviewed the clip, and it's actually more involved/complex than that!<br/><br/>The panther knocks the PC prone as <i>part of the narration of the PC's failed attack</i> (!!!), and then, as part of the panther's failed attack, the situation is narrated as being somewhat back to status quo (although it sounds like the PC is still likely prone, the next action settles the fight, so we don't really get to find out whether the prone-ness was just colour or mechanically significant).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484217/#Comment_484217" name="Item_152" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-25T08:29:17+00:00" title="May 25, 2019  8:29AM">May 25</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haven't gotten to see the TV programme yet but note that all characters can knock prone (it costs one attack &amp; you need to succeed on a strength check) it's just more cheap for the panthers in terms of action econ; the good part about this kind of design is that fights become more varied because various monster types will tend to favor various kinds of attacks. If I were to make the game I'd make monsters just be one number (HD) but I can def appreciate the pros along with the cons of the D&amp;D-isms.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484223/#Comment_484223" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-25T08:48:26+00:00" title="May 25, 2019  8:48AM">May 25</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, I see!

(I'd hope the diegetic details would change that, by adding a different sort of richness - instead of "in this fight, I got touched by wights because the dice said so", it's "what do we know about the wights, and do we want to risk letting them touch us, despite having few hit points left?" - but I think you could easily be right about that, as well.)<br/><br/>However, one thing I like about my proposal is how it uses HP the way they're meant to be used: to pace the fight and stave off deadly outcomes.<br/><br/>In D&amp;D as-written, you, a powerful warrior with tons of HP, get in a fight with the wights or ghouls or whoever. Your weakling (that is, fewer HP) friend is fighting by your side.<br/><br/>It's entirely possible that the very first blow means you get hit and level drained or wounded or infected or whatever. That's good for variety! But also kind of goes against the whole idea of HP as pacing mechanism.<br/><br/>We might have, for instance, the powerful fighter get level drained on the first blow, but still (otherwise) be in great fighting shape. Meanwhile, his companion could get hit multiple times and lose the fight or even die, but never get level drained (because all the saves were successful).<br/><br/>Under my proposed system, fights would tend to go "we fight for a while, maneuvering, but no one can land a real blow / I get low on HP so I can no longer avoid your attacks outright, so I get touched and level drained/infected/whatever as I'm on the verge of losing the fight / then I die". <br/><br/>(There would still be some variety, like if the warrior decided to be stingy with the hit points and let himself take a blow right away, but it would be based on player decisions instead of random dice rolls.)<br/><br/>I originally brought this forward because it seems to match the aesthetics of combat you wanted so well: it's all bloodless at first, then eventually there's the potential to suffer a magic effect or poison (as a sort of warning call, maybe), and eventually a lethal blow.<br/><br/>Curious to hear your thoughts! What kind of variety are you afraid of losing?<br/><br/>(I do take your point on the hassle of rewriting the rules, of course; it's not a concern for me, since I'm not actually planning to do it at that level, but I can see that being a very real one.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484382/#Comment_484382" name="Item_165" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-27T02:10:50+00:00" title="May 27, 2019  2:10AM">May 27</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>You used that analogy before.
