Like <b>Rust Hulks</b> which offers space exploration trucking style \u2013 a mixture of Alien, Firefly with parts of Star Wars \u2013 while being Powered by the Apocalypse. Which is an enticing combination. I am as well tempted by <b>Quietus</b>, a role-playing game that aims to provide \u201emelancholic horror\u201c in the style of movies like Oculus or The Strangers. It\u2019s fitted for smaller group of one to two players plus a GM and is designed to be experienced in One -Shots, system-wise it\u2019s one of the first \u201ePowered by the Dark\u201c systems \u2013 named after Blades in the Dark \u2013 I\u2019ve noticed. Speaking of Blades, there is the <b>BLADE RPG</b>, while being a fantasy game I am still drawn in by the beautiful artwork, an interesting system and the sympathetic video presention.<br/><b>The StoryMaster\u2019s Tales \u201eWeirding Woods\u201c</b> is the first of three\u2026 I\u2019ll call \u201aem \u201ehybrid rpgs\u201c. With Weirding Woods being more traditional and basically combinig tabletop rpg with board game elements in a fantasy setting. <b>Escape in the Dark</b> on the other hand provides a Science Fiction setting and offers an interesting mix of tabletop rpg, game book and Hands of Fate (the videogame, imho). Last but not least of the three is <b>CircleTales Adventures</b>, an interesting storytelling game in the more literal sense.<br/>If you like Larp and Poker, take a look at <b>The Deal</b> \u2013 which aims to bring both together. I personally do recommend the Patreon of <b>Blood on the Thames</b>. They do offer really cool V5 actual plays and I think their efforts deserve support. If you like The Dark Eye, the translation of the famous German rpg, you should considering checking the <b>Magic of Aventuria</b> sourcebook by Ulisses \u2013 from my understanding an integral part to the enjoyment of the setting and game.<br/>There are, of course, many more cool projects, just take a look:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>3 Role-Playing Games<br/>3 Hybrid Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Larp<br/>1 Patreon<br/>2 Sourcebooks<br/>3 Adventures<br/>3 Dice Projects<br/>1 Accessoires<br/>1 Enamel Pin<br/>2 Map Projects<br/>1 Youtube Series<br/>3 Various RPG Projects<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Online Platform<br/><br/>Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/06/02/crowdfunding-collection-108/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2019/06/02/crowdfunding-collection-108/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teylen" title="Teylen"><img alt="Teylen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teylen">Teylen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485650/#Comment_485650" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-09T12:18:26+00:00" title="June  9, 2019 12:18PM">June 9</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/06/09/crowdfunding-collection-109/" rel="nofollow">Crowdfunding Collection no. 109, including every tabletop project started between 06/02 and 06/09.</a><br/><br/>This week I\u2019d really like to highlight Adventures in <b>Austerion</b>. The game offers stunning artworks and is a fascinating mix of a boardgame and a tabletop rpg without loosing the latter identity. It\u2019s available in English and French and I backed it the moment I found the project, I do highly recommend checking it out. Another interesting game is <b>Sleepaway</b>. The game focuses on campsite horror story and does so by using the Belonging Outside Belonging System from Avery Alder, thus I am tempted. If you are looking for a traditional approach, check out <b>Dungeons &amp; Delvers</b>. It offers exploring dungeons, killing monsters and looting all with a system inbetween D&amp;D 3E and 5E. If you like D&amp;D5E you\u2019ll find that both <b>Amazing Adventures</b> and <b>Rocket Age RPG</b> use the system. Amazing Adventures aims to offer a setting neutral approach, enabling you to play horror, SF, modern, pulp and games set in other genres. In contrast Rocket Age does focus on the titular genre. <b>Battlestations DIRTSIDE</b> isn\u2019t a D&amp;D 5E yet am wonder how much of an RPG is it at all, as game set in a SciFi setting boarders the line of board- and tabletop roleplaying game. <b>Native American Role-Playing Game</b> is a more ttrpg and has a very interesting pitch, yet the presentation of the project took my enthusiasm down and I haven\u2019t got trust that it will deliver. <b>Stormforged</b> on the other hand looks way better and appears to deliver a solid fantasy game.<br/>There are more cool projects like <b>Necronomiconis</b> by Artisano Del Reyes (on Kickstarter and Verkam) which aims to produce a stunningly beautiful Cthulhu accessoire book. Then there\u2019s the French urban fantasy game <b>Cities and Crimes</b>, which I would have backed in a blink of an eye, were they to deliver to Germany. Thus I have to hope that enough French, Belgian and Swiss gamers back it so it comes to be.<br/>There are many, many more cool crowdfundings, see for yourself:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>5 Role-Playing Games<br/>2 D&amp;D 5E based Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Hybrid Role-Playing Game<br/>1 Setting<br/>3 Sourcebooks<br/>2 Adventures<br/>5 Dice Projects<br/>1 Dice Accessoire<br/>2 Deluxe Accessoires<br/>1 Soundscape<br/>2 Notebooks<br/>4 Various RPG Projects<br/>1 Other Game<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Deluxe Accessoire<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/><b>Italian Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/>Artikel: &lt;&lt;a href="<a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/06/09/crowdfunding-collection-109/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://teylen.blog/2019/06/09/crowdfunding-collection-109/</a>"&gt;<a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/06/09/crowdfunding-collection-109/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://teylen.blog/2019/06/09/crowdfunding-collection-109/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
