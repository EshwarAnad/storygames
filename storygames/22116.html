As a general rule we tried to leave unmodified as many things as possible, because part of a good Robbins-style West Marches is in having enough players. We didn't want to use D&amp;D because it tended to be too cumbersome (I've had bad experiences with West Marches games and wasting lots of time explaining to players how to build characters, and how long it can take to prepare adventure locations), so Dungeon World was a next best option with lots of popularity, and we didn't want to ruin that by homebrewing the entire game from the ground up.<br/><br/>That said, the default picture of Dungeon World (as well as some of its rules and contents) did not mesh well with prep heavy game. We tried to be excruciatingly clear that this would not play like many improvisation-heavy story-forward Dungeon World campaigns people might be used to, and that a few changes had been made where necessary to support a planning-based play experience.<br/>\n<blockquote>Can you give some examples of how the new moves looked?</blockquote>\nI actually made a little <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d6usJM2X9lPyLjwEdVsZb6I2BrimRwSN69QEs2KBK4k/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Google Docs hyperlink adventure booklet</a> for precisely this purpose with new players. That includes <b>all</b> the Dungeon World rules, though, including the ones that weren't changed, so I'll discuss some of the ones that were specifically changed here. <br/><br/>As mentioned previously, we tried to avoid changes where we plausibly could. So this typically led to 3 kinds of changes: clarifications (the most common), tweaks to existing Moves (less common), and the creation of new Moves (least common).<br/><br/>Clarifications were often of the sort like how most Moves actually implicitly involve the term "relevant" or "makes sense". From experience I've found lots of people who interpret the Moves without this idea of "makes sense in the fiction so far" in mind have trouble playing the game, so we made these clarifications where they were needed. Here are four representative examples.<br/><br/>As a kind of ur-example, if you gain +1 Forward from acquiring knowledge of a monster's weak spot on its belly this would reasonably apply to your next <b>Hack &amp; Slash</b> or <b>Volley</b> Move. But probably it wouldn't apply to <b>Last Breath</b>, because why would it? Many clarifications of this sort were made throughout the Moves -- if it doesn't make coherent sense, obviously you can't do it.<br/><br/>A similar clarification was made to Hack &amp; Slash. To be <b>in melee</b> means you are in a conflict at short range where you and something else are trying, and have the ability, to hurt each other physically. If you can't hurt it or it can't hurt you, that's just GM Moves deciding that based on what makes sense (generally: it bops you in the face or you bop it in the face, respectively).<br/><br/><b>Spout Lore</b> was clarified to point out how you are consulting your character's knowledge, and your character reasonably <i>wouldn't</i> know a lot of the things you wish they did in a game about exploring an unknown continent. <br/><br/><b>Discern Realities</b> clarifies two things that I believe were present in the original rules but many people miss. One: basic sensory details are always provided by the GM in their description of what is happening or as answers to basic player questions. The Move is for learning <i>more</i> than that, including relying on your character's in-world reasoning capabilities beyond those of the player. The example I gave in the document was that the GM will tell you about the six thumb-sized holes in the wall, but "What here is not what it appears to be" could reveal that they're probably part of a dart trap and "what should I be on the lookout for?" would mention you should be looking out for those holes, they seem dangerous. Two: question 3 and 4 look like they ask the same thing, so we decided "what should I be on the lookout for?" meant dangerous things while "what here is useful or valuable" means good or useful things.<br/><br/>So there are lots of clarifications and minor alterations of those sorts.<br/><br/>For bigger alterations, <b>Last Breath</b> and <b>Make Camp</b> are good candidates.<br/><br/><b>Last Breath</b> was a rare case of finding a bit of inspiration in Freebooters on the Frontier (or that other one that's almost exactly like it, I forget the name). It now reads like this:<br/><br/><b>Last Breath</b><br/>When <b>you\u2019re dying and someone checks your body within a few hours</b>, you catch a glimpse of the true face of Death (the GM will describe it). Rumors have long said that Death will offer the strong a game of chance against their life. The rumors are true. Take Death\u2019s Black Dice and Roll+NOTHING. \u2734On a 10+, Death allows you to continue: you\u2019re in a bad spot, but alive. \u2734On a 7\u20139, Death offers you a bargain. Take it and stabilize or refuse and pass beyond the Black Gates into whatever fate awaits you. \u2734On 6-, your fate is sealed. You are now marked as Death\u2019s own, and must die. The GM will tell you when and how. Usually \u2018right now, messily.\u2019<br/><br/>Checking the body was from whatever source that was and I thought it was cool, because it's like "did that 200 foot fall really kill them or did they miraculously survive somehow?" (Hey, it happened -- three times, if you can believe it...). It adds just one more mystery to investigate in a game about investigating mysteries, and it adds a lot of gameplay. At least once a sole survivor rallied a whole new crew in town within the hour to embark on a new expedition to save their fallen comrades.<br/><br/>The other major change is that the 2d6+nothing roll is framed diegetically as literally playing a game of chance for your life with the avatar of Death. We decided early on to make the game as diegetic as possible, which extended to the Skype discussion group (which represented in-character conversations in the Cock &amp; Whistle Tavern and Taphouse -- actual in character conversation was rare here, but it was an abstracted form of something actually happening in the game world), the forum for game listings and town happenings were locations in the town (you've heard of Virtual Bulletin Board, now get ready for Virtual Real Bulletin Board), connected in-game and out-of-game time (each week out of game contained a month of time in game, leading to a new season every 3 weeks), and we even gave the GMs characters in the game world (two scribes who were hired to record the adventures of the players as they were reported to them and generally serve as their secretaries by providing the players with all kinds of important town information -- I regret to say that experiments with playing as this character while running an actual game session met limited success and was dropped, but they were more successful outside of the game session).<br/><br/>In Dungeon World vanilla <b>Make Camp</b> basically heals you to full. But in this campaign nature is fundamentally hostile, so that didn't make a lot of sense. We reduced the healing to 5+CON HP, and required you to carry rations or suffer serious consequences like accumulating debilities.<br/><br/>Some new Moves included things like <b>Forced March</b> (roll to resist fatigue), <b>Carouse</b> (a total re-write of the existing party move for spending money in town to throw a big party celebrating yourself and become famous, which awarded a kind of meta-game leaderboard points), or <b>Return to Town</b> (a total re-write of the Move for getting XP and resolving Bonds). There were also Moves specific to downtime in the town.<br/><br/>So that's basic and special Moves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon" title="Jon"><img alt="Jon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon">Jon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484999/#Comment_484999" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-02T20:47:24+00:00" title="June  2, 2019  8:47PM">June 2</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> GM moves and ... playbook</p></div></blockquote>\nRegarding Playbooks:<br/><br/>Some playbooks required more re-writing than others. We decided at the outset that since it would be a dark fantasy setting and we would have a lot of players (we aimed for around 16, 8 to 10 of which would be playing at least once a week) we would have all the core classes (except Druid -- being at one with nature in a game about exploring hostile unknown nature didn't really fit), the official Barbarian, plus as many of the classes as we could justify from <i>Grim World</i> the fan supplement. We ended up adding one more (a Monk we cobbled together from various sources plus our own brains), which left us with 13 character classes.<br/><br/>The most major rewrites were probably of the Bard (who would you talk to? it's just monsters and trees out there for the most part; we re-wrote it as more like Dandelion from The Witcher, a person focused on learning and knowledge from stories who accompanies the characters to record their exploits, plus a bit of charm and magic on the side and a special focus on the Fame meta-game), Monk (as mentioned it was created roughly ex nihilo as a blend between eastern-style martial artist and sage and western-style literate academic), and Ranger (more of a woodsman or hunter and less of a living compass and pet-owner to keep with the 'nature is hostile' theme). We did make minor changes to most classes, mainly in keeping with the theme of "players often can't just make stuff up" and the needs of long term campaign play. I can talk more about specific examples if you'd like but this is getting pretty long.<br/><br/>Finally, GM Moves largely remained the same, the main change to those was in how we had a system to standardize their usage. For example, under certain conditions we would always damage characters in certain ways in fights. This was partly for consistency that benefited the players trying to figure out the way things worked, but it was also partly because we had two people running sessions and we didn't want the game to be noticeably different depending which GM you had. So a lot of the changes "under the hood" were playstyle things more than rule things. That said we did also make some systems of our own for things like exploration-based XP and things like that.<br/><br/>Anyway I can say more but goodness look how long I've gone on already. Hopefully that's a pretty thorough answer to your question about Moves and how we changed them in terms of the actual rules.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485007/#Comment_485007" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T03:54:43+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  3:54AM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good answers!

Did you document all the \u201cunder the hood\u201d changes to MC moves, and applying them consistently? How did this work?</p></div></blockquote>\nI assume we documented it, though I don't know where that piece of history went so I'll be relying on my memory here.<br/><br/>Before I get to the Moves I'd like to have a quick sidetrack into the Agenda/Principles, since all Moves ought to be made in accordance with the Agenda and Principles. In general, there's nothing wrong with any of these for running a more traditional style prep-oriented game, they just require a certain point of view.<br/><br/>For example, here's what Adam Koebel told me when I sent him an email about my plan to run a more traditional or prep-heavy Dungeon World:\n<blockquote>So, the big thing about the whole 'collaborative storytelling universebuilding blah blah blah' is that it's a dial. Our marketing for the game is all about how you can include your players and stuff but honestly, you don't have to. You can dial the player feedback meter to zero, if you really want to. Ask them ONLY what their characters are feeling and thinking and leave it at that. Don't feel bad about it, either. I've run completely traditional style games of Dungeon World with a published adventure. The point is, then, to never play to guide the PCs in a certain direction. To let them explore the world and get into trouble wherever they like as they learn what you, as the GM, already know. It's still fun, it's still awesome and the core rules of the game are still there. Just ask questions whenever you feel like it and build on what you do ask about. Don't feel like you have to hand over the authoritative control [...]</blockquote>\nSo, that was emblematic of the sorts of ways we interpreted the principles and agenda. For example, to ask questions and use the answers doesn't mean to ask players what's in the chest they just opened (in fact, Koebel, LaTorra - and relatedly John Harper - all pretty much walked back on that kind of question ever being a good idea; these days they all prefer to ground player-established world details in things the character ought to know, at least).<br/><br/>The biggest changes in implementation in the GM Moves were probably related to combat stuff like <b>Deal damage</b> and wandering-monster-type uses of things like <b>Show signs of an approaching threat</b>. <br/><br/>I don't remember all of the specifics, but for the former we had lots of rules of thumb like "on 9 or less Hack &amp; Slash if it makes even the remotest bit of sense be sure to deal HP damage in addition to whatever else happens" or "warn PCs of potential bodily mutilation on the first hit before actually doing it." When players got hit automatically, what triggered Defy Danger before they could perform this Move, how to handle fighting while outnumbered, things like that were all fairly standardized and all threats were designed to be strongly telegraphed.<br/><br/>Since combat was a big place where GM preference can really alter the difficulty and experience of the game we thought this area of standardization was one of the most important. We also re-did how monsters were generated pretty substantially, and we got a lot of mileage out of all of our monsters having specific weaknesses, somewhat beefier than vanilla DW stats (so we could rely less on being mean with our Moves and more on numbers), and building their Moves together so we both understood how they were supposed to work. <br/><br/>We definitely also came up with something about how PCs escape from monsters but I can't recall what it was.<br/><br/>Regarding stuff like "Show signs of an approaching threat" used to indicate approaching monsters or something, we did also have a random encounter system we cooked up. It ended up being a bit overcomplicated and unfinished (a rule for anyone making a West Marches campaign: if you're tempted to say "I'll finish that later" be prepared for it to remain unfinished). When we did our post-campaign discussion, though, nobody had noticed anything wrong with it, so I guess it was sufficient.<br/><br/>We were also both very on board with the general way to play Dungeon World in a player-skill-challenge oriented fashion, namely that players should be actively seeking to get what they want by doing something that obviously works but doesn't invoke a Move wherever possible (and only then resorting to Moves they're good at, Moves they're not good at, and doing things that will be obviously bad for them but with no corresponding Move, in that order). In post-campaign interviews the players seemed to get this idea pretty quickly if they hadn't already, so I'd guess that meant our GM Moves on 7-9s or Misses were pretty punishing and pretty consistent, which is exactly how we intended it to be. <br/><br/>If you're interested in specific impressions from the player's side of things, though, feel free to ask <a href="/forums/profile/Vivificient">@Vivificient</a>.<br/><br/>You can imagine the general case of how these changes were made by imagining two Dungeon World GMs coming up with a common game situation and then being like "how would you adjudicate that?" and then arguing about it for 45 minutes (or an hour... or two hours...) until we came to a rough consensus. That way we'd run the game consistently, and that'd go on to benefit any players who were interested in figuring out how the game worked "under the hood" for their own benefit. <br/><br/>We did end up having a bit of a fight over whether one or the other of us had adhered to these decisions properly at least once that I can remember (probably more like a small handful of times). But by and large it worked well, and the impression I got from the campaign veterans was that it felt pretty consistent and predictable. So the bottom line is probably just that deciding to follow certain rules of thumb to standardize your approach to the game works, whether or not you mess with the Moves themselves or what the rules of thumb you develop happen to be.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485084/#Comment_485084" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T18:34:29+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  6:34PM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These generous and detailed accounts are very much appreciated by yours truly\u2665                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485087/#Comment_485087" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T18:44:44+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  6:44PM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jon,<br/><br/>That's a fantastic overview!

I appreciate your interest as well.\n<blockquote>Do you remember any examples of that? I'm curious what "level" of the game they came in on (e.g. prep vs. adventure design vs. MC moves vs. adjudicating particular player-side moves).</blockquote>\nThe one that comes to mind was to do with maiming PCs. A player had got their finger caught in a mimic and my compatriot GM had it get torn off, which I thought was in line with our standard. But then he said it was OK to re-attach it with Cure Light Wounds, although it would not regain its functionality. I thought that violated our common understanding of Cure Light Wounds not being able to re-attach lost limbs at all, regardless of whether the limb worked or not after. So we had a bit of a spat over that, and the fate of the finger was in limbo ever since.\n<blockquote>Is this kind of an illustration of the way the two GMs spent some time getting on the same page, or would you actually make a point to do this before running the game?</blockquote>\nIt's a typical description of how all of our actual rules got made. We were both fairly argumentative people, though, so I imagine it wouldn't have to take as long as it often took us. It'd also be faster if you didn't need two people to agree and were just doing it by yourself. We didn't run a game with two GMs in the same session, so this was all prep work.\n<blockquote>How much of a range was there between your two "adjudications", and what helped you get on the same page?</blockquote>\nSometimes it was as easy as "oh yeah I do that the same way," other times we had to come up with a whole procedure because we had never really thought about it before. One example that comes to mind is we spent some time talking about different circumstances in which a player would just get hit by something in combat. Like, if you're fighting two guys and one is on each side of you does that count? Both in front? One ahead and one behind? What about doing something else while there's an archer overlooking the whole situation 50 yards away? Over the course of an hour or so we basically exhausted all the common scenarios we could think of where somebody might just take damage without getting a <b>Defy Danger</b> or anything, and then we made a big list of the ones where we agreed it would definitely happen.<br/><br/>One example of something we didn't bother to standardize was how we selected players to spotlight during combat. I tended to just go with whatever made sense as the next most pressing thing based on a combination of speed, importance, and making sure nobody gets left out for more than a few minutes at a time. He preferred to pick an arbitrary order and just cycle through it. But because of how Dungeon World works regarding how consequences rarely happen to you unless you first take action we thought it would be equally fair either way we decided to handle who sits out and when.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon" title="Jon"><img alt="Jon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon">Jon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485118/#Comment_485118" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T21:01:29+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  9:01PM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2019 9:12PM by Jon.">edited June 3</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It sounds like you either don't remember or didn't document [all the standards, monster stats, and running away], but they sound really vital and important to making this work. Any chance you have some of it somewhere (in email records, perhaps)?</blockquote>\nWell, I want to be careful in answering some of these because one of my rules for running West Marches is I never reveal any of the world content to the players other than what they find, and I have one of my players running around this forum =P<br/><br/>I can answer to a pretty large degree stuff about systems and rules, though, insofar as they don't give away any secrets about the world.<br/><br/>Regarding fleeing monsters I think we never wrote it down and I don't remember the specifics of what Moves got made when from actual cases from the game. I could contact some of the players who were involved in the more famous chases but there's no guarantee they'd respond or remember anything. <br/><br/>I can say some things about the monster system, though, because that was recorded for reference purposes.<br/><br/>We built the system number-wise to balance around two goals: that a monster shouldn't just gib a wizard with minimum hit points (in our game 12) and that an "appropriate encounter" ought to badly hurt but not kill a "typical party" of Fighter, Ranger, Cleric, and Wizard if they just trade back and forth. The assumption was that players should be finding cleverer ways of fighting than just trading Hack &amp; Slash back and forth with the monsters if they wanted to get by with more than the skin of their teeth. <br/><br/>In practice this happened sometimes, so go us, but more commonly the Barbarian and Fighter players got into it with the monsters and the other players supported them by holding the flanks and dealing with unexpected problems so they could keep at pitched combat with their superior damage, armor, and HP. This is because Barbarians and Fighters actually have a very substantial advantage in a straight fight compared to the other classes on account of how Dungeon World's numbers work, so monsters calibrated to challenge a "typical party" overall are not nearly as much of a challenge to a Fighter or Barbarian in particular. This led to a funny dichotomy where, depending on their preferred method of dealing with monsters, some players treated <b>Defend</b> as the Second Coming while others treated it as patently useless. Some enemies totally dismantled this style, though, so it wasn't happening every time.<br/><br/>Anyway, we basically made our balance rules around running sims of a few "boring combats" like that. In the end we decided a peer monster (a monster meant to square off against one PC) should start around 8 HP and with d8 damage, and to adjust from there depending on the intended level and number appearing. Unlike Sage I think "stuff gets less HP if there's more of it in a group" is more about game balance than realism, but I like having good game balance even at the expense of realism in edge cases (armies of human soldiers, prides of lions, etc.) so that's fine by me. In retrospect I think slightly lower HP and slightly more damage may have been more prudent since fights took a little longer than I wanted (quick fights being another reason to pick Dungeon World over, for example, 3rd edition D&amp;D), and fulfilling the goal of not gibbing the Wizard while challenging the Fighter on raw numbers proved to be tenuous, and I'd rather challenge the Fighter than not gib the Wizard.<br/><br/>On top of that monsters got various <b>Strengths</b> based on the intended level of their PC opponents. A higher level monster had slightly bigger stats, but also things like the Messy tag, some narrative advantage that tends to require Defy Dangers to be made, a specifically advantageous environment, or handing out Debilities. All monsters also had one or more <b>Weaknesses</b>, which were fictional positioning elements that  gave a dramatic advantage over them in a conflict if utilized.<br/><br/>Monsters also had the usual DW <b>Instincts</b>, which we treated as their overarching goal in life, and <b>Tells &amp; Behaviors</b>, which covered telegraphing that the monster was about and what it was trying to do on a moment to moment basis. The monster's Moves were the particular things it would do to fulfill its Behaviors, which in turn would lead to fulfilling the Instincts. They also all had <b>Origins</b>, which were a major source of XP if discovered (they often weren't).<br/><br/>To give you an example of all this, one of the first monsters we designed was a kind of ten foot tall bog monster covered in rusty chains and padlocks that lived in a lake far from town (we referred to him affectionately as Rusty). He wasn't the highest level monster that existed, but he was near the middle of the level 1-10 spectrum.  We chose his extra levels to grant a bit of extra Damage (we thought this made sense as he was physically quite big) and a fair whack of Armor (we thought this made sense because of the giant metal chains). Being a solitary monster grants some additional survivability, so we opted for a bit of extra HP and also a Defy Danger type defense (the chains acted as Reach+ weapons you had to get past to close the distance).<br/><br/>Some of his Strengths the players experienced but never noted were that he was very intimidating (basically an aura of fear that caused DDs to approach), he was extremely strong (Forceful tag), and he could wrap people up in the chains and loved dragging them into the lake with him since he didn't have to breathe air (so that's a strength of being adapted to its environment as mentioned earlier). I recall a few PCs almost drowned this way.<br/><br/>I don't want to talk about one of the Moves or the Tells &amp; Behaviors because those contain a few things I don't think anybody ever experienced, but the other two Moves make obvious sense: <b>Enwrap in Chains</b> (from its strength of the chains) and <b>Do a Massive Punch</b> (from being Forceful).<br/><br/>Finally, they did note the monster's main <b>Weakness</b>, which they had exploited: you could unlock the chains if you dared to use the keyed padlocks, rendering him much less potent (being without weapons or armor). \n<blockquote>Do you see the campaign as a success? Would you run something like it again? Would you recommend it to others, or only with certain changes/caveats?</blockquote>\nI'd say it did many of the things we wanted it to do, but in a kind of limited or reduced capacity from what we imagined in many cases. I think a revised version could be very successful by fixing these problems, but what we had was pretty good and was probably worth doing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485142/#Comment_485142" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T23:48:00+00:00" title="June  3, 2019 11:48PM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That\u2019s excellent, thank you!<br/><br/>(Though I\u2019ve always wondered what the purpose of the \u201cmessy\u201d tag is.

The risk with not doing that is either a) the session is a total bust or b) they get there then try going someplace you hadn't prepared yet when they realize it's going to be a bust.

It involves a player, let's call them D. <br/><br/>D and some pals were exploring some crypts near the town when one of his pals has to leave unexpectedly. He's a cool dude so he says "you guys can run my character to help out in a fight or whatever just don't get me killed" so the session can continue. D is a bit of a power gamer so this is no problem, he can run any character in a combat. As the session goes on they run out of healing surges, which in 4th edition means they basically can't recover hit points anymore and this is a dangerous state of affairs to be in. D's compatriots want to return to the town, wary of losing their comrade's character in his absence, but D says (and this is nearly a direct quote): "You can go back if you want, but I bet the boss is behind this next door so I'm going in whether you come with me or not."<br/><br/>You can imagine what happened next.<br/><br/>This was the singularly most deserved PC death I have witnessed in thousands of hours of RPG play except <i>perhaps</i> the time a Barbarian drank from a fountain of acid with a skeleton in it. They had already guessed successfully that a big scary monster was behind this next door, their friends urged them not to, and they ran ahead into a trap I was in the middle of describing. There's really not much I can do to help stop that series of events if I'm supposed to be a hands-off referee.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I was blamed (called a "Killer DM," in fact). Technically it <i>was</i> my fault: I built the whole world they were playing in, and I could have given every monster 1 hit point and 0 damage if I wanted. But I don't think that's very reasonable, so instead I mostly tried to follow the DMG's encounter guidelines. The lesson I took away from this is that some players are just determined to see the GM's hand in everything no matter how strictly they follow design guidelines and telegraph dangers and all the rest.<br/><br/>Long story short, I'd imagine there are parallels between these cases. But that's just a guess. The unfortunate thing about players leaving online games is they usually don't stick around to do an exit interview.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I\u2019m learning about Freebooters of the Frontier which seems to be more of a blorby take on DW?</p></div></blockquote>\nIt's more like "I want to do an OSR hexcrawl with lots of random generation, but in a Dungeon World way." It's very cool and I highly recommend it, but not really for the purpose of a prep-forward game.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Vivificient" rel="nofollow">Vivificient</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>And there was somebody else who complained the GM used the \u201cdeal damage\u201d move too often in combat, rather than offering them interesting choices.</p></div></blockquote>\nThe funny thing about this incident is that nobody even hit 0 HP. Since nothing even happens to you in Dungeon World from losing HP <i>per se</i> until you hit 0 HP I had a hard time understanding how this could be using <b>Deal Damage</b> too much. For all the color and flavor in that battle I may as well have not even hurt anybody at all.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was just because the fight involved too much fighting and not enough... whatever else you do in a fight. I don't recall that they specifically asked for more interesting choices, though, just that I was doing <b>Deal Damage</b> too much. So we're left to guess at their motivation.<br/><br/>Either way, that player made a principled stand to never play in a session I ran again. I couldn't understand it.<br/><br/>So, regarding:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>(And what problems are we talking about in the first place?)</p></div></blockquote>\nOne problem was definitely something to do with player expectations. I'm not entirely sure how to solve this, but it was a real struggle gaining and retaining enough players to have a real big tent feeling, which to me is one of the leading features of an open table game like West Marches. Typically you were looking at around 1 person in 8 making it from application to first session, and a bunch of those people left too.<br/><br/>One part of the problem is obviously just the fact that we were running an online game on Roll20. Random online players have never been the most reliable people. <br/><br/>Many of them probably saw "great for someone with an inconsistent schedule" and thought "low commitment game!" West Marches is actually a <i>higher commitment</i> style than meeting once a week because in addition to playing in the game the players have a host of other responsibilities: scheduling sessions, talking with other players to tell them how their session went, saying what their character does between sessions, and so on. The GM isn't leading you on a fun-house tour whether you want to go or not, you need to make the game happen.<br/><br/>Another possible part of the problem is we used a system "against type," as it were. I'm not sure how we could have been clearer about this -- online players, again, not being well known for reading a 250 word explanation of what this game is like and why it's not like most Dungeon World games on the application page. We required a small application to weed out this sort of thing (name, skype contact info, what interested you about the game, nothing crazy), but I'd still get applications by people named JewStomper (yes, really) that consisted entirely of: "imma need in". No, JewStomper. I'mma need you out, actually.<br/><br/>Finally, joining the game mid-stream may have been too overwhelming. By the time there were 40 unsorted almanac pages and a janky paint-and-tile map covering a few hundred square kilometers that was a lot to take in for a new player. And without enough knowledge about the state of the world they often couldn't get time to shine on their first expedition to <i>Everybody-But-Them-Knows-This-Place</i> Gulch.<br/><br/>The core of veterans at the end all pretty much said the same thing: "I knew it wasn't story game style Dungeon World going into it, and I think it was a pretty good choice of a system given how you handled it. I got exactly what I expected." As for why all these other people weren't getting what they expected I have no idea.

There's no, "now roll initiative." You can freely use the combat moves along with trying to parley, or interact with the environment, or escape, or whatever. I <i>think</i>, perhaps, that one of the emergent features of Jon and his co-GM's modifications was less of that feeling: combat became more rigorously adjudicated, and thus more of "its own thing" in the game, separate from "normal" play.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that's bad, not at all.

A particularly good example is the guy who lassoed a giant bird. It did not particularly like being lassoed, so it took off and did a tight bank -- he lost his grip (<b>Defy Danger</b> 6-) and fell hundreds of feet to his mangled, instant death.<br/><br/>Overall, though, the game was surprisingly low on PCs actually dying or being subjected to <b>Last Breath</b> given the tone and difficulty. Three early on, then a few in dribs and drabs over the following months. That said, probably about a score came within a roll of one or the other, so it wasn't exactly a cakewalk.\n<blockquote>[healing, being maimed, effects on long term play?]</blockquote>\nWe had developed a few in-world solutions for this sort of injury, though the players never ended up pursuing them so I won't say more in the interest of secrecy. <br/><br/>The one major injury of this sort that I recall was a badge of honor for Handel the Skirmisher, who was the previously mentioned character missing a leg below the knee. He was one of the ones who got maimed by Last Breath, in this case as the result of - what else - falling from a great height. <br/><br/>He replaced his missing leg with a hook leg (long story) his compatriot had stolen from a rascally pirate (an even longer story), and spent several in-game months basically doing physical therapy in the town rather than the normal town moves to eventually recover his lost mobility. Maintaining it was no problem since he took the Advanced Move in his class that basically made him a handyman. Aside from the occasional stumble in janky terrain he made a full recovery, and I like to think he resembled one of those people with the modern high tech curved runner's prosthetics, but, like, medieval style.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" rel="nofollow">Deliverator</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>[DW flows nicely between combat and exploration]</p></div></blockquote>\nI can't say I lean towards this as the definite explanation, though since I don't have a great explanation myself I have to concede that you may be totally right for all I know. For the record I like the system for the same reason you do.<br/><br/>Did we use <b>Deal Damage</b> enough so the players would notice? Yeah. But, I mean, if the monsters aren't damaging you then what are they even doing? As for other decisions based on standardized procedures, if we imagine 5 alternate universes in which I'm faced with the same situation I'd imagine I make the procedure-based decision in 2 or 3 of them anyway, so I don't think things were particularly rigid or unnatural. We had plenty of talking turn into fights and plenty of fights turn into talking, sometimes by the baddies' initiative and other times by the players' (especially considering the game setting was a hostile wilderness full of hungry abominations). As the cherry on top I practice Renaissance martial arts so I pay special attention to fictional positioning in combat compared to most GMs. As far as I could tell we weren't hung up on rigid procedures and numbers.<br/><br/>Speaking of fictional positioning and consistency in and out of combat, I remembered another guideline I developed partway through the campaign that I believe is actually fundamental to the style and in fact is applied to most adjudications in a given session.<br/><br/>DW is very forward about rolling in the open and the GM is encouraged to not even roll the dice at all. That's cool, and it certainly prevents traditional fudging of results by fudging the numbers on the dice. But changing the numbers on your dice isn't the only way to fudge the <i>result</i> of a dice test. In traditional games the numbers on the dice mean certain things, so you use the mechanism of the face-up numbers to change it to the result you want. In DW, though, you don't have to fudge the <i>numbers</i> to get a desired result because you can fudge the <i>thing the numbers mean</i> by executing a softer or different Move after you see the 6- hit the table than you would have done in a vacuum.<br/><br/>While technically rules legal, and not always committed consciously, I call this a kind of fudging and I think it's bad for two reasons -- I believe in general, but certainly at least under the traditional challenge/sim-oriented playstyle. <br/><br/>One reason is that I think in practice you'll find the Move you would pre-commit to is <i>much</i> harder than the Move you would actually make after the 6- hits the table. Your only concern when pre-committing is what would reasonably happen, and preferably be interesting, as the result of failure. You don't have to concern yourself with the fact that with the 6- already on the table your Move choice is all that stands between a PC and death and that you will be personally responsible for killing them if you arbitrarily choose to do so.<br/><br/>The other reason is that pre-committing gives the players more information about their action, and having more information leads to more informed choices, and more informed choices leads to better play because something something a game is a series of interesting choices (thanks Sid Meier).<br/><br/>So the delivery I developed is that whenever it would make any sense at all I would tell the player what would likely happen if their attempt failed (so sometimes not for snap reactions or if the character would reasonably not know what would happen if they failed like on <b>Discern Realities</b> in an empty room or whatever). <br/><br/>In addition to circumventing the two problems mentioned above (inconsistent/wimpy Moves and lack of information), it also has two further benefits.<br/><br/>One of those benefits is foregrounding fictional positioning. Often players will make a prudent plan in Dungeon World but not feel like it had any effect on the outcome because it wasn't good enough to skip the roll entirely and they rolled a 6- and bad stuff happened anyway. With this method if they were trying to climb a cliff with no equipment I could say something like "OK, but if you fail in you're probably going to plummet to your death on the jagged rocks jutting out of the ocean down below." And then the player would go "<i>WAIT, I HAVE ROPE!</i>" and they'd anchor themselves with rope and I'd go "OK, now if you fail you won't plummet to your death, but when you're caught by the rope that'll jerk you around and might bang you into the cliff or knock something loose out of your pack or something like that." This makes the advantage gained from smart planning in the fiction very apparent in a form like "without this plan, X would have happened if you failed; but now with this plan Y will happen if you fail instead, which is much better." This idea can also apply to successes if needed.<br/><br/>The other benefit is that the players become immediately involved in making a fair, impartial game as your helpers. Where Ben saw lots of potential in 3e's fairness-as-bureaucracy (everyone gets the same rules, no exceptions), this method offers fairness-as-democracy (everyone gets a say about whether something is fair before it happens so that if the GM is about to make a genuine error they can catch themselves better). Obviously the final say must rest in the GM as the referee, but fairness-by-group-consensus is one powerful way to take the arbitrary sting out of fundamentally fiat-based systems like selecting a GM Move. And with legit players calling <i>you</i> on wimpy Moves, in a weird way you get the same kind of fair result by consensus rather than by writ.<br/><br/>So that was a long digression but long story short I don't think I ran combat really differently than I normally would.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485186/#Comment_485186" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-04T13:12:51+00:00" title="June  4, 2019  1:12PM">June 4</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing about this project though\u2026 I remember one of my friends asking me about DW and I said "lol you really want us to switch to a game where there's around 40% chance of fumbling on every roll?" 6- rolls happen <i>often</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485189/#Comment_485189" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-04T13:18:24+00:00" title="June  4, 2019  1:18PM">June 4</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>One thing about this project though\u2026 I remember one of my friends asking me about DW and I said "lol you really want us to switch to a game where there's around 40% chance of fumbling on every roll?" 6- rolls happen <i>often</i></p></div></blockquote>\nAssuming that players are leaning on their higher stats to frame their actions, the probability is much lower (25% on a +2 Stat, 14% on a +3).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485193/#Comment_485193" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-04T13:30:01+00:00" title="June  4, 2019  1:30PM">June 4</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're right, and with a +1 it's a little under 30%.

We erred on the side of being jerks on a 6- for consistency with our setting and tone, but you don't necessarily have to do that all the time. That quote from the infamous Dungeon World combat primer you had in the other thread is all about how fudging the difficulty of a 6- is technically rules legal, and to be fair it is. You could also just hand out extra +1s to stats or whatever more frequently, but from experience Dungeon World characters are tough and can handle a lot of failure unless you decapitate them every time they take damage.<br/><br/>It can also help just how you frame failure in the narrative. A trick I picked up from <i>Stalker: The SciFi Roleplaying Game</i> is that unless the plan was really bad and bound to fail (in which case they probably shouldn't even get a roll, since rolling implicitly requires the possibility of success) you should narrate player failure as not really being their fault - the situation imposed on them. Anybody can effectively 10+ <b>Hack &amp; Slash</b> on a target dummy (because you don't even have to roll), but against a live target your 6- isn't just you sucking: the baddie's trying to stay alive, too! If they <b>Defy Danger</b> 6- to jump a chasm they don't trip, their impressive leap was just not far enough. If they <b>Parley</b> 6- they don't stutter and mumble, the target just doesn't react to the leverage in the way you might have expected - who could have guessed?<br/><br/>Incidentally, "a missed roll is an embarrassing fumble" probably has its memetic origin in a poor reading of D&amp;D's combat system if I had to guess. A poor reading because actually a "miss" in D&amp;D combat doesn't mean a failure to connect, it means that there weren't any <i>effective</i> hits. Maybe the opponent dodged your blow that was otherwise well-aimed, maybe their armor shrugged it off, maybe they parried (not that D&amp;D gives an AC bonus for having a weapon, though it probably should given how hard it is to block a sword with your bare hands). And originally a to-hit roll represented something like a minute of scuffling, so to say that you swung wildly at the air and missed like a buffoon for a full minute is kind of ridiculous if you think about it critically, nearly as much so as treating HP as "meat points" where you take full axe blows right to the nose to no effect 3 or 4 times before suddenly keeling over dead. But that's not really on topic I guess, just a personal theory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485203/#Comment_485203" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-04T13:50:51+00:00" title="June  4, 2019  1:50PM">June 4</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post.<br/><br/>It's true that our own house rules (thinking of the "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dndtheory/comments/bqlk01/hit_points_in_my_game_good_bad_news/" rel="nofollow">Oh, Injury!</a>" subsystem that me and Paul cooked up in the "<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22060/d-d-2097e-remapping-diegesis-mimesis-and-all-kinds-of-sis#latest" rel="nofollow">remapping thread</a>") it's pretty lethal if you fail both lines of defense.

Before the start of the game, they had been developing it for, I don't know, a year or two?  It always felt very big, full of details, and endlessly expansive in every direction.<br/><br/>There were a lot of different ruined towns and manor houses, and I'm certain that there was a complex backstory involving all of them and how they became ruined, feuds between different nobles, etc., although I don't think any of the players managed to put all the pieces together.  The one player who had figured out the most of the lore got promoted to GM after Jon's original co-DM quit the game (possibly to focus on his PhD thesis, but he never explained, just mysteriously stopped answering messages...).<br/><br/>It was also an ever-changing world.  The scenery would change with the seasons, old sites would burn down, new monsters would move into the area.  There were these awful porcupine monsters that were big <i>and</i> spiky <i>and</i> sneaky <i>and</i> agile that we were always trying to wipe out completely, but a few would always get away and then next time they would return in greater numbers.  There was one region we always tried to avoid (the "Bell Forest") because we couldn't figure out how to deal with the crazy goddess who lived there; but eventually the whole darn forest started moving around the map of its own accord, blocking our favourite routes and making us seek out new ones or risk travelling through it.<br/><br/>The least enjoyable aspect of the campaign was the scheduling (so, nothing to do with the in-game system).  We had players from many time zones so it was a hassle trying to get a game together.  Often we ended up falling into groups who would go at similar times each week for a few weeks at a stretch, since that was easier to schedule--but less ideal for the West Marches theory of playing with mixed groups.<br/><br/>It could be challenging deciding where to go on the big map because just from looking at the map it wasn't obvious which sites had been cleared and which sites had only been scouted.  Theoretically we should have been keeping each other up to date in the Skype chat for the game, but there was so much off-topic chatter and random anime memes that I didn't keep up with it.  Usually when trying to schedule a game I would just blunder into the chat and say "Hey, where's a good place to go have an expedition?" and hope someone knew somewhere.  Otherwise I would simply aim to return to the last place i'd been and push farther in the same direction (which was hazardous because if you kept forcing your way forward you would pretty soon get out of the level-appropriate zone into the "giant hell bird eats your friend" zone.  (And then once the "giant hell bird eats your friend" zone was on the map, people would think "that sounds cool" and keep going back there...)<br/><br/>I can't really compare this Dungeon World to other Dungeon World games because it is the only Dungeon World game I have played in.  I can compare it to D&amp;D games I have played, since it was arguably a Dungeon World trying to stand in for D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Compared to D&amp;D, the monsters were harder to nail down for a fair fight.  In D&amp;D (especially 3e and 5e), the monsters often hit very hard in a straight fight, so you want to hit and run, or mess them up with zone control spells and debuffs.  In this game, it was the opposite--If we could get them to stand still and trade blows, then we'd quickly form a shield wall (a good formation since it let us trigger a mix of <b>Hack &amp; Slash</b> and <b>Defend</b> moves) and the battle was as good as won.  But they were all tricky bastards--either they would attack quickly and then leap 10 feet to safety, or they'd outrun us and hide in the high grass, or they'd leap out the window and climb onto the roof, then harass us with ranged weapons.<br/><br/>The world felt very deadly, even if we didn't actually die that often.  There was a definite feeling (as I've told Jon before) of having to insert yourself into the mousetrap to get the cheese.<br/><br/>However, unlike D&amp;D, armour in Dungeon World is very dependable (shaving n damage off each blow, on top of what you can manage with <b>Defend</b> moves), so health usually didn't deplete very rapidly.  That may not have been the impression of all the players, since my guy (a zealous lawful-netural exterminate-the-unholy templar type) was probably the most heavily armoured character around.  I tended to use my hit points as a gauge of when to reteat.<br/><br/>The dice could certainly always betray you.  I tended to have extraordinary luck when I needed it most (which, in character, I attributed to Divine Intervention on my righteous behalf).  My particular playbook was full of "win more" moves that only triggered on a 10+, but could (literally) work miracles when they worked.  So when things got really bad my MO was to try to keep stalling and triggering moves on favourable stats...<br/><br/>There were some areas in which I found the move system of Dungeon World slightly anti-immersive.  We had a bit of a joke (not <i>too</i> serious, but slightly serious) about "Never ask questions!" because if we asked too many questions we could trigger a "Discern Realities" roll, and then on a miss the GM could trigger some negative move.  This is basically similar to D&amp;D when you don't want to spend too long searching a useless room, lest a wandering monster show up, but perhaps a little less deeply fictional feeling.<br/><br/>Likewise, there were a couple times when I felt like we (the adventurers) had taken reasonable precautions to pre-empt any negative consequence of a course of action, but then the GM still made us roll defy danger and inflicted something bad on a failure.  One case I remember (this was the other DM, not you Jon) was where we were climbing a cliff... something like this happened:<br/><br/>Me: I climb the cliff<br/>GM: Defy danger<br/>Me: (miss)<br/>GM: You slip and fall<br/>Me: OK, but I'm still tied to the rope as established<br/>GM: OK, in that case you drop your shield<br/>Me: Well, I also mentioned that my shield was tied to me<br/>GM: OK, you make some noise and it attracts a monster...<br/><br/>That might not be exactly how it went, but it was something along those lines, and it felt a bit unfair.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485228/#Comment_485228" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-04T15:46:24+00:00" title="June  4, 2019  3:46PM">June 4</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, that\u2019s a great example of how the AW move system makes it hard to adapt to challenge-based playing.

In retrospect some of it was wasted theorizing, too.\n<blockquote>There were a lot of different ruined towns and manor houses, and I'm certain that there was a complex backstory involving all of them and how they became ruined, feuds between different nobles, etc., although I don't think any of the players managed to put all the pieces together. </blockquote>\nThere was and they didn't, respectively. This is probably another problem worth fixing: the ability to find out about past history without resorting to knowing lost foreign languages or magical scrying of some sort is rather limited. I have a new found respect for the abuse of audiologs and journal entries in video games because your options really are quite limited -- and I say this as a history major with training in how to find stuff out about the past from historical artifacts!\n<blockquote>It was also an ever-changing world.  The scenery would change with the seasons, old sites would burn down, new monsters would move into the area.</blockquote>\nI recently stumbled on a system we made for this that involved rolling 2d6 every season. I don't think we actually used it, though. Restocking the world and random encounters were two things we were going to rigorously systematize but just kind of didn't and rolled out with a half-done system that it turns out was sufficient as far as the players were concerned (this is why I keep talking about fairness being largely in the eye of the beholder).\n<blockquote>Compared to D&amp;D, the monsters were harder to nail down for a fair fight.  In D&amp;D (especially 3e and 5e), the monsters often hit very hard in a straight fight, so you want to hit and run, or mess them up with zone control spells and debuffs.  In this game, it was the opposite--If we could get them to stand still and trade blows, then we'd quickly form a shield wall (a good formation since it let us trigger a mix of <b>Hack &amp; Slash</b> and <b>Defend</b> moves) and the battle was as good as won.  But they were all tricky bastards--either they would attack quickly and then leap 10 feet to safety, or they'd outrun us and hide in the high grass, or they'd leap out the window and climb onto the roof, then harass us with ranged weapons.</blockquote>\nThis goes back to what I was saying earlier about the Big Combat Numbers classes making hash of a monster that would in turn make hash of a Middling Combat Numbers class like a Cleric in a straight fight. Dungeon World just isn't very granular in that way by comparison to something like D&amp;D thanks to rolling on a small bell curve and having numbers no bigger than around 20 for anything. <br/><br/>When we found this out in the testing we figured we needed a way to make monsters competitive with players beyond a straight fight, which is why we invented the system of Strengths and Weaknesses to give a rough balance pass to fictional positioning. I'm not sure if you were there for the first encounter with the infamous porcupine monsters at the manor house, but they had been living there a while and the session devolved into what could charitably be called "Tork looting the whole house by himself while everyone else experienced Fantasy Vietnam." Upstairs, downstairs, climbing improvised ropes made of sheets, through windows, hurling projectiles, tossing furniture down flights of stairs, hiding around blind corners and ambushing people using merely sound cues (by both parties!), one side driving the other away merely through the ferocity of their assault seizing key terrain only for the other party to return at a new angle, it really had it all. It even culminated in one of those famous chases back to town that I don't remember how they worked.\n<blockquote>So when things got really bad my MO was to try to keep stalling and triggering moves on favourable stats...</blockquote>\nWhich worked on multiple occasions, as I recall. Your class more than most preferred doing Moves that would have high stats involved, even compared to automatic successes without triggering Moves for the reason you gave about the 10+'s, and I think you did a good job of exploiting that. Or at least you got lucky every single time it counted, which to me implies a good job I suppose.\n<blockquote>There were some areas in which I found the move system of Dungeon World slightly anti-immersive.  We had a bit of a joke (not <i>too</i> serious, but slightly serious) about "Never ask questions!" because if we asked too many questions we could trigger a "Discern Realities" roll, and then on a miss the GM could trigger some negative move.</blockquote>\nYeah. The Moves where the GM Move doesn't obviously follow are the hardest to adjudicate in a way that seems natural. Like, OK, your character reasoned about what here is dangerous but got a 6-. Flatly stating "you don't know" is fine, I guess, but it doesn't do a lot to move the scene forward. And the things that do move the scene forward often don't really follow, or require improvisation that wouldn't be acceptably prep-forward.<br/><br/>Notably this is a weakness D&amp;D shares to a degree, not just in the way you noted but even in its general structure where it's hard to make diegetic consequences and this leads to a stalled out scene: "I roll perception." - 5 - "Dang. Guess I don't learn anything. Hum." <i>time passes</i> "I roll insight..."\n<blockquote>Likewise, there were a couple times when I felt like we (the adventurers) had taken reasonable precautions to pre-empt any negative consequence of a course of action, but then the GM still made us roll defy danger and inflicted something bad on a failure. </blockquote>\nYeah, this is exactly why I developed the method of stating the failure condition that relates fictional positioning to the outcome explicitly. This kind of situation where it doesn't matter what you do because you trigger a roll and then the roll is 6- so something bad happens is very frustrating from a challenge and fairness perspective because it's kind of blatantly cheating the player out of their good ideas. Sometimes you need a good idea to justify rolling at all (often in the case of Hack &amp; Slash), but sometimes your good idea should influence the outcomes of the roll instead, and if it doesn't (or even if you just can't tell that it does!) then that kind of sucks.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
