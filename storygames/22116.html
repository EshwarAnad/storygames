As a general rule we tried to leave unmodified as many things as possible, because part of a good Robbins-style West Marches is in having enough players. We didn't want to use D&amp;D because it tended to be too cumbersome (I've had bad experiences with West Marches games and wasting lots of time explaining to players how to build characters, and how long it can take to prepare adventure locations), so Dungeon World was a next best option with lots of popularity, and we didn't want to ruin that by homebrewing the entire game from the ground up.<br/><br/>That said, the default picture of Dungeon World (as well as some of its rules and contents) did not mesh well with prep heavy game. We tried to be excruciatingly clear that this would not play like many improvisation-heavy story-forward Dungeon World campaigns people might be used to, and that a few changes had been made where necessary to support a planning-based play experience.<br/>\n<blockquote>Can you give some examples of how the new moves looked?</blockquote>\nI actually made a little <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d6usJM2X9lPyLjwEdVsZb6I2BrimRwSN69QEs2KBK4k/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Google Docs hyperlink adventure booklet</a> for precisely this purpose with new players. That includes <b>all</b> the Dungeon World rules, though, including the ones that weren't changed, so I'll discuss some of the ones that were specifically changed here. <br/><br/>As mentioned previously, we tried to avoid changes where we plausibly could. So this typically led to 3 kinds of changes: clarifications (the most common), tweaks to existing Moves (less common), and the creation of new Moves (least common).<br/><br/>Clarifications were often of the sort like how most Moves actually implicitly involve the term "relevant" or "makes sense". From experience I've found lots of people who interpret the Moves without this idea of "makes sense in the fiction so far" in mind have trouble playing the game, so we made these clarifications where they were needed. Here are four representative examples.<br/><br/>As a kind of ur-example, if you gain +1 Forward from acquiring knowledge of a monster's weak spot on its belly this would reasonably apply to your next <b>Hack &amp; Slash</b> or <b>Volley</b> Move. But probably it wouldn't apply to <b>Last Breath</b>, because why would it? Many clarifications of this sort were made throughout the Moves -- if it doesn't make coherent sense, obviously you can't do it.<br/><br/>A similar clarification was made to Hack &amp; Slash. To be <b>in melee</b> means you are in a conflict at short range where you and something else are trying, and have the ability, to hurt each other physically. If you can't hurt it or it can't hurt you, that's just GM Moves deciding that based on what makes sense (generally: it bops you in the face or you bop it in the face, respectively).<br/><br/><b>Spout Lore</b> was clarified to point out how you are consulting your character's knowledge, and your character reasonably <i>wouldn't</i> know a lot of the things you wish they did in a game about exploring an unknown continent. <br/><br/><b>Discern Realities</b> clarifies two things that I believe were present in the original rules but many people miss. One: basic sensory details are always provided by the GM in their description of what is happening or as answers to basic player questions. The Move is for learning <i>more</i> than that, including relying on your character's in-world reasoning capabilities beyond those of the player. The example I gave in the document was that the GM will tell you about the six thumb-sized holes in the wall, but "What here is not what it appears to be" could reveal that they're probably part of a dart trap and "what should I be on the lookout for?" would mention you should be looking out for those holes, they seem dangerous. Two: question 3 and 4 look like they ask the same thing, so we decided "what should I be on the lookout for?" meant dangerous things while "what here is useful or valuable" means good or useful things.<br/><br/>So there are lots of clarifications and minor alterations of those sorts.<br/><br/>For bigger alterations, <b>Last Breath</b> and <b>Make Camp</b> are good candidates.<br/><br/><b>Last Breath</b> was a rare case of finding a bit of inspiration in Freebooters on the Frontier (or that other one that's almost exactly like it, I forget the name). It now reads like this:<br/><br/><b>Last Breath</b><br/>When <b>you\u2019re dying and someone checks your body within a few hours</b>, you catch a glimpse of the true face of Death (the GM will describe it). Rumors have long said that Death will offer the strong a game of chance against their life. The rumors are true. Take Death\u2019s Black Dice and Roll+NOTHING. \u2734On a 10+, Death allows you to continue: you\u2019re in a bad spot, but alive. \u2734On a 7\u20139, Death offers you a bargain. Take it and stabilize or refuse and pass beyond the Black Gates into whatever fate awaits you. \u2734On 6-, your fate is sealed. You are now marked as Death\u2019s own, and must die. The GM will tell you when and how. Usually \u2018right now, messily.\u2019<br/><br/>Checking the body was from whatever source that was and I thought it was cool, because it's like "did that 200 foot fall really kill them or did they miraculously survive somehow?" (Hey, it happened -- three times, if you can believe it...). It adds just one more mystery to investigate in a game about investigating mysteries, and it adds a lot of gameplay. At least once a sole survivor rallied a whole new crew in town within the hour to embark on a new expedition to save their fallen comrades.<br/><br/>The other major change is that the 2d6+nothing roll is framed diegetically as literally playing a game of chance for your life with the avatar of Death. We decided early on to make the game as diegetic as possible, which extended to the Skype discussion group (which represented in-character conversations in the Cock &amp; Whistle Tavern and Taphouse -- actual in character conversation was rare here, but it was an abstracted form of something actually happening in the game world), the forum for game listings and town happenings were locations in the town (you've heard of Virtual Bulletin Board, now get ready for Virtual Real Bulletin Board), connected in-game and out-of-game time (each week out of game contained a month of time in game, leading to a new season every 3 weeks), and we even gave the GMs characters in the game world (two scribes who were hired to record the adventures of the players as they were reported to them and generally serve as their secretaries by providing the players with all kinds of important town information -- I regret to say that experiments with playing as this character while running an actual game session met limited success and was dropped, but they were more successful outside of the game session).<br/><br/>In Dungeon World vanilla <b>Make Camp</b> basically heals you to full. But in this campaign nature is fundamentally hostile, so that didn't make a lot of sense. We reduced the healing to 5+CON HP, and required you to carry rations or suffer serious consequences like accumulating debilities.<br/><br/>Some new Moves included things like <b>Forced March</b> (roll to resist fatigue), <b>Carouse</b> (a total re-write of the existing party move for spending money in town to throw a big party celebrating yourself and become famous, which awarded a kind of meta-game leaderboard points), or <b>Return to Town</b> (a total re-write of the Move for getting XP and resolving Bonds). There were also Moves specific to downtime in the town.<br/><br/>So that's basic and special Moves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon" title="Jon"><img alt="Jon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon">Jon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484999/#Comment_484999" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-02T20:47:24+00:00" title="June  2, 2019  8:47PM">June 2</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> GM moves and ... playbook</p></div></blockquote>\nRegarding Playbooks:<br/><br/>Some playbooks required more re-writing than others. We decided at the outset that since it would be a dark fantasy setting and we would have a lot of players (we aimed for around 16, 8 to 10 of which would be playing at least once a week) we would have all the core classes (except Druid -- being at one with nature in a game about exploring hostile unknown nature didn't really fit), the official Barbarian, plus as many of the classes as we could justify from <i>Grim World</i> the fan supplement. We ended up adding one more (a Monk we cobbled together from various sources plus our own brains), which left us with 13 character classes.<br/><br/>The most major rewrites were probably of the Bard (who would you talk to? it's just monsters and trees out there for the most part; we re-wrote it as more like Dandelion from The Witcher, a person focused on learning and knowledge from stories who accompanies the characters to record their exploits, plus a bit of charm and magic on the side and a special focus on the Fame meta-game), Monk (as mentioned it was created roughly ex nihilo as a blend between eastern-style martial artist and sage and western-style literate academic), and Ranger (more of a woodsman or hunter and less of a living compass and pet-owner to keep with the 'nature is hostile' theme). We did make minor changes to most classes, mainly in keeping with the theme of "players often can't just make stuff up" and the needs of long term campaign play. I can talk more about specific examples if you'd like but this is getting pretty long.<br/><br/>Finally, GM Moves largely remained the same, the main change to those was in how we had a system to standardize their usage. For example, under certain conditions we would always damage characters in certain ways in fights. This was partly for consistency that benefited the players trying to figure out the way things worked, but it was also partly because we had two people running sessions and we didn't want the game to be noticeably different depending which GM you had. So a lot of the changes "under the hood" were playstyle things more than rule things. That said we did also make some systems of our own for things like exploration-based XP and things like that.<br/><br/>Anyway I can say more but goodness look how long I've gone on already. Hopefully that's a pretty thorough answer to your question about Moves and how we changed them in terms of the actual rules.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485007/#Comment_485007" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T03:54:43+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  3:54AM">3:54AM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good answers!

Did you document all the \u201cunder the hood\u201d changes to MC moves, and applying them consistently? How did this work?</p></div></blockquote>\nI assume we documented it, though I don't know where that piece of history went so I'll be relying on my memory here.<br/><br/>Before I get to the Moves I'd like to have a quick sidetrack into the Agenda/Principles, since all Moves ought to be made in accordance with the Agenda and Principles. In general, there's nothing wrong with any of these for running a more traditional style prep-oriented game, they just require a certain point of view.<br/><br/>For example, here's what Adam Koebel told me when I sent him an email about my plan to run a more traditional or prep-heavy Dungeon World:\n<blockquote>So, the big thing about the whole 'collaborative storytelling universebuilding blah blah blah' is that it's a dial. Our marketing for the game is all about how you can include your players and stuff but honestly, you don't have to. You can dial the player feedback meter to zero, if you really want to. Ask them ONLY what their characters are feeling and thinking and leave it at that. Don't feel bad about it, either. I've run completely traditional style games of Dungeon World with a published adventure. The point is, then, to never play to guide the PCs in a certain direction. To let them explore the world and get into trouble wherever they like as they learn what you, as the GM, already know. It's still fun, it's still awesome and the core rules of the game are still there. Just ask questions whenever you feel like it and build on what you do ask about. Don't feel like you have to hand over the authoritative control [...]</blockquote>\nSo, that was emblematic of the sorts of ways we interpreted the principles and agenda. For example, to ask questions and use the answers doesn't mean to ask players what's in the chest they just opened (in fact, Koebel, LaTorra - and relatedly John Harper - all pretty much walked back on that kind of question ever being a good idea; these days they all prefer to ground player-established world details in things the character ought to know, at least).<br/><br/>The biggest changes in implementation in the GM Moves were probably related to combat stuff like <b>Deal damage</b> and wandering-monster-type uses of things like <b>Show signs of an approaching threat</b>. <br/><br/>I don't remember all of the specifics, but for the former we had lots of rules of thumb like "on 9 or less Hack &amp; Slash if it makes even the remotest bit of sense be sure to deal HP damage in addition to whatever else happens" or "warn PCs of potential bodily mutilation on the first hit before actually doing it." When players got hit automatically, what triggered Defy Danger before they could perform this Move, how to handle fighting while outnumbered, things like that were all fairly standardized and all threats were designed to be strongly telegraphed.<br/><br/>Since combat was a big place where GM preference can really alter the difficulty and experience of the game we thought this area of standardization was one of the most important. We also re-did how monsters were generated pretty substantially, and we got a lot of mileage out of all of our monsters having specific weaknesses, somewhat beefier than vanilla DW stats (so we could rely less on being mean with our Moves and more on numbers), and building their Moves together so we both understood how they were supposed to work. <br/><br/>We definitely also came up with something about how PCs escape from monsters but I can't recall what it was.<br/><br/>Regarding stuff like "Show signs of an approaching threat" used to indicate approaching monsters or something, we did also have a random encounter system we cooked up. It ended up being a bit overcomplicated and unfinished (a rule for anyone making a West Marches campaign: if you're tempted to say "I'll finish that later" be prepared for it to remain unfinished). When we did our post-campaign discussion, though, nobody had noticed anything wrong with it, so I guess it was sufficient.<br/><br/>We were also both very on board with the general way to play Dungeon World in a player-skill-challenge oriented fashion, namely that players should be actively seeking to get what they want by doing something that obviously works but doesn't invoke a Move wherever possible (and only then resorting to Moves they're good at, Moves they're not good at, and doing things that will be obviously bad for them but with no corresponding Move, in that order). In post-campaign interviews the players seemed to get this idea pretty quickly if they hadn't already, so I'd guess that meant our GM Moves on 7-9s or Misses were pretty punishing and pretty consistent, which is exactly how we intended it to be. <br/><br/>If you're interested in specific impressions from the player's side of things, though, feel free to ask <a href="/forums/profile/Vivificient">@Vivificient</a>.<br/><br/>You can imagine the general case of how these changes were made by imagining two Dungeon World GMs coming up with a common game situation and then being like "how would you adjudicate that?" and then arguing about it for 45 minutes (or an hour... or two hours...) until we came to a rough consensus. That way we'd run the game consistently, and that'd go on to benefit any players who were interested in figuring out how the game worked "under the hood" for their own benefit. <br/><br/>We did end up having a bit of a fight over whether one or the other of us had adhered to these decisions properly at least once that I can remember (probably more like a small handful of times). But by and large it worked well, and the impression I got from the campaign veterans was that it felt pretty consistent and predictable. So the bottom line is probably just that deciding to follow certain rules of thumb to standardize your approach to the game works, whether or not you mess with the Moves themselves or what the rules of thumb you develop happen to be.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485084/#Comment_485084" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T18:34:29+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  6:34PM">6:34PM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These generous and detailed accounts are very much appreciated by yours truly\u2665                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485087/#Comment_485087" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T18:44:44+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  6:44PM">6:44PM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jon,<br/><br/>That's a fantastic overview!

I appreciate your interest as well.\n<blockquote>Do you remember any examples of that? I'm curious what "level" of the game they came in on (e.g. prep vs. adventure design vs. MC moves vs. adjudicating particular player-side moves).</blockquote>\nThe one that comes to mind was to do with maiming PCs. A player had got their finger caught in a mimic and my compatriot GM had it get torn off, which I thought was in line with our standard. But then he said it was OK to re-attach it with Cure Light Wounds, although it would not regain its functionality. I thought that violated our common understanding of Cure Light Wounds not being able to re-attach lost limbs at all, regardless of whether the limb worked or not after. So we had a bit of a spat over that, and the fate of the finger was in limbo ever since.\n<blockquote>Is this kind of an illustration of the way the two GMs spent some time getting on the same page, or would you actually make a point to do this before running the game?</blockquote>\nIt's a typical description of how all of our actual rules got made. We were both fairly argumentative people, though, so I imagine it wouldn't have to take as long as it often took us. It'd also be faster if you didn't need two people to agree and were just doing it by yourself. We didn't run a game with two GMs in the same session, so this was all prep work.\n<blockquote>How much of a range was there between your two "adjudications", and what helped you get on the same page?</blockquote>\nSometimes it was as easy as "oh yeah I do that the same way," other times we had to come up with a whole procedure because we had never really thought about it before. One example that comes to mind is we spent some time talking about different circumstances in which a player would just get hit by something in combat. Like, if you're fighting two guys and one is on each side of you does that count? Both in front? One ahead and one behind? What about doing something else while there's an archer overlooking the whole situation 50 yards away? Over the course of an hour or so we basically exhausted all the common scenarios we could think of where somebody might just take damage without getting a <b>Defy Danger</b> or anything, and then we made a big list of the ones where we agreed it would definitely happen.<br/><br/>One example of something we didn't bother to standardize was how we selected players to spotlight during combat. I tended to just go with whatever made sense as the next most pressing thing based on a combination of speed, importance, and making sure nobody gets left out for more than a few minutes at a time. He preferred to pick an arbitrary order and just cycle through it. But because of how Dungeon World works regarding how consequences rarely happen to you unless you first take action we thought it would be equally fair either way we decided to handle who sits out and when.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon" title="Jon"><img alt="Jon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon">Jon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485118/#Comment_485118" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T21:01:29+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  9:01PM">9:01PM</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2019 9:12PM by Jon.">edited 9:12PM</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It sounds like you either don't remember or didn't document [all the standards, monster stats, and running away], but they sound really vital and important to making this work. Any chance you have some of it somewhere (in email records, perhaps)?</blockquote>\nWell, I want to be careful in answering some of these because one of my rules for running West Marches is I never reveal any of the world content to the players other than what they find, and I have one of my players running around this forum =P<br/><br/>I can answer to a pretty large degree stuff about systems and rules, though, insofar as they don't give away any secrets about the world.<br/><br/>Regarding fleeing monsters I think we never wrote it down and I don't remember the specifics of what Moves got made when from actual cases from the game. I could contact some of the players who were involved in the more famous chases but there's no guarantee they'd respond or remember anything. <br/><br/>I can say some things about the monster system, though, because that was recorded for reference purposes.<br/><br/>We built the system number-wise to balance around two goals: that a monster shouldn't just gib a wizard with minimum hit points (in our game 12) and that an "appropriate encounter" ought to badly hurt but not kill a "typical party" of Fighter, Ranger, Cleric, and Wizard if they just trade back and forth. The assumption was that players should be finding cleverer ways of fighting than just trading Hack &amp; Slash back and forth with the monsters if they wanted to get by with more than the skin of their teeth. <br/><br/>In practice this happened sometimes, so go us, but more commonly the Barbarian and Fighter players got into it with the monsters and the other players supported them by holding the flanks and dealing with unexpected problems so they could keep at pitched combat with their superior damage, armor, and HP. This is because Barbarians and Fighters actually have a very substantial advantage in a straight fight compared to the other classes on account of how Dungeon World's numbers work, so monsters calibrated to challenge a "typical party" overall are not nearly as much of a challenge to a Fighter or Barbarian in particular. This led to a funny dichotomy where, depending on their preferred method of dealing with monsters, some players treated <b>Defend</b> as the Second Coming while others treated it as patently useless. Some enemies totally dismantled this style, though, so it wasn't happening every time.<br/><br/>Anyway, we basically made our balance rules around running sims of a few "boring combats" like that. In the end we decided a peer monster (a monster meant to square off against one PC) should start around 8 HP and with d8 damage, and to adjust from there depending on the intended level and number appearing. Unlike Sage I think "stuff gets less HP if there's more of it in a group" is more about game balance than realism, but I like having good game balance even at the expense of realism in edge cases (armies of human soldiers, prides of lions, etc.) so that's fine by me. In retrospect I think slightly lower HP and slightly more damage may have been more prudent since fights took a little longer than I wanted (quick fights being another reason to pick Dungeon World over, for example, 3rd edition D&amp;D), and fulfilling the goal of not gibbing the Wizard while challenging the Fighter on raw numbers proved to be tenuous, and I'd rather challenge the Fighter than not gib the Wizard.<br/><br/>On top of that monsters got various <b>Strengths</b> based on the intended level of their PC opponents. A higher level monster had slightly bigger stats, but also things like the Messy tag, some narrative advantage that tends to require Defy Dangers to be made, a specifically advantageous environment, or handing out Debilities. All monsters also had one or more <b>Weaknesses</b>, which were fictional positioning elements that  gave a dramatic advantage over them in a conflict if utilized.<br/><br/>Monsters also had the usual DW <b>Instincts</b>, which we treated as their overarching goal in life, and <b>Tells &amp; Behaviors</b>, which covered telegraphing that the monster was about and what it was trying to do on a moment to moment basis. The monster's Moves were the particular things it would do to fulfill its Behaviors, which in turn would lead to fulfilling the Instincts. They also all had <b>Origins</b>, which were a major source of XP if discovered (they often weren't).<br/><br/>To give you an example of all this, one of the first monsters we designed was a kind of ten foot tall bog monster covered in rusty chains and padlocks that lived in a lake far from town (we referred to him affectionately as Rusty). He wasn't the highest level monster that existed, but he was near the middle of the level 1-10 spectrum.  We chose his extra levels to grant a bit of extra Damage (we thought this made sense as he was physically quite big) and a fair whack of Armor (we thought this made sense because of the giant metal chains). Being a solitary monster grants some additional survivability, so we opted for a bit of extra HP and also a Defy Danger type defense (the chains acted as Reach+ weapons you had to get past to close the distance).<br/><br/>Some of his Strengths the players experienced but never noted were that he was very intimidating (basically an aura of fear that caused DDs to approach), he was extremely strong (Forceful tag), and he could wrap people up in the chains and loved dragging them into the lake with him since he didn't have to breathe air (so that's a strength of being adapted to its environment as mentioned earlier). I recall a few PCs almost drowned this way.<br/><br/>I don't want to talk about one of the Moves or the Tells &amp; Behaviors because those contain a few things I don't think anybody ever experienced, but the other two Moves make obvious sense: <b>Enwrap in Chains</b> (from its strength of the chains) and <b>Do a Massive Punch</b> (from being Forceful).<br/><br/>Finally, they did note the monster's main <b>Weakness</b>, which they had exploited: you could unlock the chains if you dared to use the keyed padlocks, rendering him much less potent (being without weapons or armor). \n<blockquote>Do you see the campaign as a success? Would you run something like it again? Would you recommend it to others, or only with certain changes/caveats?</blockquote>\nI'd say it did many of the things we wanted it to do, but in a kind of limited or reduced capacity from what we imagined in many cases. I think a revised version could be very successful by fixing these problems, but what we had was pretty good and was probably worth doing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
