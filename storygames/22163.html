if she made up the table at the moment it became relevant (rather than making it up while in "prep mode").  Maybe that is tier 1.5, if you make up a mechanic in the moment, rather than just making up an answer in the moment.  Then if you subsequently used that same mechanic the next time it came up, at that point it would be considered tier 2.<br/><br/>Certainly the goal is to turn things into second tier truths over time, but it's hard to completely disclaim decision-making once you already know why the fact is relevant.  You are still exercising decision-making by deciding which decision-making-disclaiming method to apply to the previously unseen situation.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>This model is great because it's easy when you start out and it lets you gradually add mechanics and prep until you have solid answers for more and more things.

I hope he's like "OK good that these theories are getting codified" and not <i>just</i> "man, Sandra's biting my whole 'hygienic' schtick\u2026"</small><br/><br/>However I do not use the 50/50 coin flip rule. A \xbd chance of <i>any whim</i> being true is too much for me.<br/><br/>My tier-3 policy is to go safe &amp; boring ("OK, there's nothing in there") and then patch the hole. And by safe &amp; boring I mean saliency wise, not entertainment wise. For example I have to improvise a family? They don't have much resources to give nor a big demand of resources. (Safe &amp; boring re the adventurer's logistics game.) But I'll try to bring it when it comes to portraying them interestingly.<br/><br/>But one could incorporate the recursive coin flip rule, or another similar rule (make up four things and roll a die) <i>into</i> the tier-3 blorb principle directly instead of having it live at the tier 2 layer. For example, if you go to tier-3, you use rec coin flip <i>and</i> then commit to patch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_486762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon" title="Jon"><img alt="Jon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon">Jon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486762/#Comment_486762" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-07-07T13:08:42+00:00" title="July  7, 2019  1:08PM">July 7</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 7, 2019 1:11PM by Jon.">edited July 7</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi 2097, I like diagrams so I like your post!

You can see the difference between the "tiers" starkly at work in the examples I gave of "disclaiming decision-making" while running Dungeon World and adjucating 6- GM Moves. <br/><br/>On a theoretical level "knowing they failed, I will choose a GM Move" and "if you fail, this is the GM Move that will be chosen" are probably going to give different results in many cases (in the same way that introducing a resolution system for a problem while in the face of that problem in the moment and introducing a resolution system for a problem before encountering that problem will probably give different resolution systems and, therefore, results), and on a practical level players obviously notice that difference if you verbalize your decision-making process and at least some seem to care about that difference.<br/><br/>While the difference is impractical to many players who will readily collapse these "tiers of truth" even all the way down to "Jon you personally suck because you personally made these monsters that are killing my character right now and I don't like it," for others the distinction matters, so I don't think discarding that distinction just because it's irrelevant some of the time is the way to go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486768/#Comment_486768" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-07-07T19:59:41+00:00" title="July  7, 2019  7:59PM">July 7</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jon" rel="nofollow">Jon</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Hi 2097, I like diagrams so I like your post!

But it's important and we don't just want to make it up! So we put our heads together and quickly whip up a reasonable random table/dice total/chart for determining a PC's weight, and use it from then on.<br/><br/>Your third tier says, "make it up and commit to patch the hole". I'm saying we can also, sometimes, do "don't make it up; patch the hole on the spot".<br/><br/><small>(Practically speaking, it depends on the particular question being asked. Some things are going to be easy - e.g. you need to randomize a character's weight and your rulebook gives a "weight range" for the type of creature they are playing - and some won't, like "what's in the safe?" Still, it's always possible if we're willing to come up with a reasonable procedure - at least, I think it is, that's why I phrased it as a question - "if we care enough" means we're willing to divert a good deal of time and attention to the problem, right here and now, because it matters that much to us.</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486770/#Comment_486770" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-07-07T20:54:11+00:00" title="July  7, 2019  8:54PM">July 7</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So that\u2019s what you meant.

I just mean that we can come up with a reasonable way to randomize or determine what's what, and then play on.<br/><br/>Examples:<br/><br/>(1)<br/><br/>Player 1: "I pull the canvas off the mirror!"<br/>GM: "No, wait! We don't know what will happen yet, because the module doesn't specify the mirror's dormant properties."<br/>Player 2: "Oh, I happen to have this handy book, with a 'd100 dormant magic mirror properties' table."<br/>GM: "Great! Hand it over, and I'll roll on that chart. [rolls and takes notes] Ok, Player 1, you were saying you want to pull off the canvas covering?"<br/><br/>(2)<br/><br/>GM: "Reading the module text here, it says that when the demon-spirit is released from confinement, it will attack the nearest target. But we haven't established exactly where everyone is."<br/>Player 1: "Oh, I said I was walking away from the altar, remember? I might have distanced myself by now." [everyone agrees it's possible]<br/>[Group negotiates for a minute and decides that each player should roll a d20, with no mods, while Player 1 rolls a d12.

It's such a common occurence that referring to it as 'the world is broken' would be rather strange at such a table, but perhaps that doesn't happen as much at your game - I get the impression you're more module-driven and less random-table driven than some OSR crowds.)<br/><br/>As for "a ruling-in-the-moment that is not likely to become promoted into a general rule"... what do you call that in your lingo?
