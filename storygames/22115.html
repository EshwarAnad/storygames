Resistant integrity along with receptive integrity.<br/><br/>Even if you <i>would</i> want to average two numbers, you'd do it directly on the Everway layer (3 and 5 = 4, unlike what this script would have it be, 4.32), or you'd look at the lowest of the two as sort of a "threshold" number, as per the Two Elements Test on p 109.<br/><br/>So this script was more of a thought experiment, just for fun. The "averway" of a 1 and a 7 becomes\u20266.02236781302845450829. <br/><br/><code>#!/bin/sh<br/>everforward () {<br/>    echo "2^(${1}-3)"|bc -ql<br/>}<br/>average () {<br/>    echo "($1 + $2)/2"|bc -ql<br/>}<br/>everbackward () {<br/>    echo "(l(${1})/l(2))+3"|bc -ql<br/>}<br/><br/>echo $(everbackward $(average $(everforward $1) $(everforward $2)))</code><br/><br/>Usage<br/><code>$ averway 1 7<br/>6.02236781302845450829</code><br/><br/>You can remove the `-3` and `+3` and the script will give the exact same results but run faster. They are only there to make the whole 3 \u2192 1, 4 \u2192 2, 2\u21920.5 thing work in case you'd want to use those functions separately.<br/><br/>One idea that I just came up with is\u2026 that instead of adding them together and dividing it by two, you'd multiply them together and then square root it. Like so:<br/><br/><code>#!/bin/sh<br/>everforward () {<br/>    echo "2^(${1}-3)"|bc -ql<br/>}<br/>multivrage() {<br/>    echo "sqrt(($1 * $2))"|bc -ql<br/>}<br/>everbackward () {<br/>    echo "(l(${1})/l(2))+3"|bc -ql<br/>}<br/><br/>echo $(everbackward $(multivrage $(everforward $1) $(everforward $2)))</code><br/><br/>That'd be way more better. A water 7 soul sister with a weak earth 1 body (a fourth as strong as a normal person) should have a combined score that reflects that; that takes the large number of the everforward(7) and makes it a quarter of the size before turning it back.<br/><br/>The funny thing that I found out is that\u2026 this give the exact same numbers as if we were to just average the numbers directly on the Everway layer. 1 and 7 becomes 4. 1 and 8 becomes 4.5. Any two numbers become their natural average.<br/><br/>Jonathan Tweet secret math genius\u2026?!

Anytime you're working in amount-space, arithmetic mean is likely natural ((2+8)*(1/2)=5). When you're working in magnitude-space, geometric mean is usually natural ((2*8)^(1/2)=4). And when you're given amounts of magnitudes, aka the logarithms of the quantity you actually care about, averaging the amounts should be the same as averaging the magnitudes.<br/><br/>In other words,<br/><br/>(A*B)^(1/2)=X<br/>(logA+logB)*(1/2)=logX<br/><br/>aka<br/><br/>(a+b)*(1/2)=x<br/>(2^a*2^b)^(1/2)=2^x                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484979/#Comment_484979" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-02T16:59:21+00:00" title="June  2, 2019  4:59PM">June 2</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is the awesomest thing I've heard all weekend!
