If you want your character to look in a drawer, say that you look in a drawer.</p><p>(I can get onboard for using these skills together with the new downtime rules in Xanathar, where you can, for example, use Persuasion to roll on the Carousing table.)</p><h2 id="using-arrows">Using arrows</h2><ul><li>You <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/arrow_threat/" rel="nofollow">only have to pay arrows when it\u2019s established</a> that an arrow must have been released.\n<ul><li>When their HP is reduced to zero by your attack</li><li>When the arrow is caught\n<ul><li>For example, when someone catches your arrow (monks can do this)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>If you do use extra arrows beyond that, that\u2019s how many you can recover after the fight.\n<ul><li>Not necessarily the same arrows, but the same amount, maybe some are lying around.</li><li>As an example of \u201cextra\u201d arrow usage, you might shoot an arrow that gets stuck in the owlbear\u2019s thick hide.</li></ul></li></ul><p>This rule means that you can (by making attack rolls against their AC) threaten someone with a drawn, loaded bowstring and their HP will be reduced by sheer terror. This rule means that you can (by making attack rolls against their AC) take successive turns aiming at someone and reducing their HP by reducing their position, their chance of surviving the fight. This rule also means that you can just spam arrows at someone, releasing an arrow every round. You describe your shooting in a way that\u2019s cool to you or that makes sense in the situation.</p><h2 id="distances-speeds">Distances &amp; Speeds</h2><p>We don\u2019t use any maps, playing boards or other minaturized spatial representation.</p><p><b>Edit:</b>Oh, wow, this part has changed a lot. We now use a system kinda similar to The One Ring with volley rounds and backrank/frontrank.</p><h2 id="initiative-systems">Initiative systems</h2><p>If one side has light \u2014 on their own person, i.e. holding torch or having a lit shield, not a lantern set down on the floor \u2014 that person, and all their allies in the same m\xeal\xe9e group, strike before opponents who don't have such light. If the light situation is equal, who ever is on their home turf strike first.</p><h2 id="we-go-to-the-statue-room">\u201cWe go to the statue room\u201d</h2><p>Since we don\u2019t use maps &amp; minis, I\u2019m more generous when players speak in predicate terms of where they want to go and not super punishing about them getting lost.</p><h2 id="left-not-north">\u201cLeft\u201d, not \u201cNorth\u201d</h2><p>I describe rooms as you would see them from your own POV, not from above. I use the room we\u2019re playing in, I make gestures, I try to make it vivid.</p><h2 id="encounter-checks">Encounter checks</h2><p>\u201cWandering monster checks\u201d are now \u201cencounter checks\u201d that the players make. They can use inspiration on these. I use whatever dice is in the particular module or region we\u2019re in, but if needed I flip it so that high is safe, low is danger.</p><h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2><p>I hand out tokens for \u201cgood roleplay\u201d. I want to have the strict definition \u201cwhen being true to your character gets them into trouble\u201d (inspired by Fate) but I sometimes can\u2019t help myself and give it out for other cool stuff as well.</p><p>You can have any amount of such tokens but if you want to give yourself, or someone else, advantage or disadvantage, the price is all of your tokens, no matter if you have 1 token or 30 tokens. This is to emulate the \u201cyou either have it or haven\u2019t it, it doesn\u2019t accumulate\u201d nature of RAW inspiration.</p><p>Also we emphatically <em>don\u2019t</em> use the common house rule that you can spend insp to get a second chance <em>after</em> a failed roll. You have to place your bet <em>before</em> you roll. This is RAW, but, since that house rule is so common this bears mentioning here.</p><p>Also we\u2019ve had the insp tokens serve double duty to be drama tokens from Dramasystem. I.e. you get one from the other when you give in (or from the pool if they have none), you get two from the other if you give in when you <strong>really</strong> don\u2019t want to give in (and if they don\u2019t have two, this can\u2019t happen), and they get three from you if you override them trying to give you two in that way (and they keep their two \u2013 again, you need to have three for that to happen).</p><p>So that\u2019s a way for it for the amount of tokens you have to matter.</p><h2 id="the-searcher">The Searcher</h2><p>A simpler class, inspired by Searchers of the Unknown and Three Sixteen. <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20658/the-searcher-very-simple-5e-class/p1" rel="nofollow">Explained here</a>.

To defend him from melee engagements you can engage the foes in separate melee groups some distance away from the wizard and when they try to leave you, you get opportunity attacks on them. That's a tactic every class can do. Conversely, if you have <a href="http://open5e.com/classes/fighter.html" rel="nofollow">the protection fighting style</a>, you can do the opposite -- stand next to the wizard and impose disadvantage on the foes with your shield.<br/><br/>Also you can engage with the environment, blocks, crates, walls etc (in predicate space rather than precise ranges and positions).\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Does it mean you can't be persuasive if you don't have two tokens, for example?</p></div></blockquote>\nThe player who adjudicates whether or not a character is persuaded is the player that plays that character.

"Oh, ok!" Says Max, and gives in. <br/><br/>Or is Max *forced* to give in when she offers him the token?<br/><br/>How do we know when you "really" don't want to give in? Is it just a question of the player saying, "No, that's going to take two tokens from you!"?<br/><br/>Now, if you offer me two tokens, can I refuse, but only by giving you three in return? And does that mean that I *can't* refuse an overture that's backed up by two tokens, unless I have at least 3 myself? That sounds like tokens would be an incredibly powerful influence, especially since I don't necessarily control when I can earn more. <br/><br/>And what does an "emotional concession" look like, if you're not actually giving in to the demand or plea?<br/><br/>I can't quite parse that first sentence I quoted from you, above, I guess! Sorry. It sounds interesting, though, so I'd like to understand it.<br/><br/>Also, do these tokens come into play when interacting with NPCs? If so, do NPCs get piles of tokens, too, or what?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471972/#Comment_471972" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-15T01:24:39+00:00" title="April 15, 2018  1:24AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>And we use the official conversion rules they released, we switched from using Stan Shinn\u2019s system to the official one.

Is it just a question of the player saying, "No, that's going to take two tokens from you!"?</p></div></blockquote>\nOK so this system is from Dramasystem, and we don't always use it. (Sometimes we just want a less drama-focused game.)<br/><br/>Here is how it works if&amp;when it's in play:<br/><br/>* Ashira wants something from Max.<br/>* Max knows that if he gives in, he'll get a token, and if he is steadfast, he'll give a token<br/>* Max chooses how to react.<br/><br/>But, you never say "No way would my character do that!"<br/>You say "No way, <i>I</i> won't do that." Because you act these scenes out in character.<br/>And the way they're acted out, how persuasive Ashira's character can be in her actual choice of words, arguments, leverage, pleading, etc etc that will affect how Max reacts.<br/>(That's true even if we don't use the tokens.)<br/><br/>And if the one who is supposed to pay one token don't have any tokens, they can pay from the "bank". That's another way more insp enters the economy.<br/><br/>Now, if Max is steadfast and Ashira wants to override his decision, she can pay two tokens. She can't force him to give him exactly what she wants, but something significant. And to counter that, Max has to pay three tokens.<br/><br/>And if the one who is supposed to pay two or three tokens don't have any tokens, they can't force or override in that way. \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Also, do these tokens come into play when interacting with NPCs?

In other words, having the player convince the GM rather than the character convince the NPC.<br/><br/>Before you rip my head off, let me explain:<br/><br/>My character is a construct, a being that I put together to play out a story. Part of that might be making this character a witty conversationalist, intuitive interrogator or expert seducer. Now just as I, a real-life person, could not put together the knife-fighting moves to kill a grizzly bear, it is entirely likely that I could not negotiate, seduce or interrogate my way out of paper bag, <br/><br/>By removing the mechanics that allow my character to be far more persuasive, seductive or intuitive than I am as a player, you are removing my ability to create a communication-led character. No tabletop systems require a player to physically fight the GM in order to defeat an NPC in combat, yet that is essentially the road being taken in removing the mechanics for communication and replacing it with player input.<br/><br/>BY all means encourage role-playing. Ask the player to give some hint as to what their character wants to say and how they want to say it. Maybe allow a bonus to the dice roll if the player comes up with a really good concept. But then let the mechanics, like an editor or stylist polishing a basic concept, take that rough idea and frame it in the way that the character would express it.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472621/#Comment_472621" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-21T15:08:27+00:00" title="April 21, 2018  3:08PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2018 3:08PM by 2097.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Sadurian, that is something that I\u2019d rather take to another thread.

In those games there\u2019s about a 40% chance to get a success-with-cost and I like that better than 25%. I mean if there\u2019s only a 25% of the ternarity of the operation mattering then why bother, I could just use a DC 15 yes/no instead.</p><p>Also a 12 is nicer to you than a 15 is and the DC for a full-no-strings-attached success is the same, 20. So it\u2019s a win/win for you too.</p><p>In the session yesterday, I offered a DC 12 for finding that particular Flaming Fist squad, and a DC 20 for also not losing yourself in the same process. (I.e 1-11: you lose them and yourself, 12-19 you find them but don\u2019t know where you are, and 20+ you find them and you also know where you are.) A DC 12 might sound like an overly easy test to find a squadron in a five mile radius area (the hexes are 10 mile diameter), but, the cost was so big so I don\u2019t regret giving you that offer. And you were smart to not take it.</p><h2 id="dc-10-and-dc-20">DC 10 and DC 20</h2><p>There is one situation where I think DCs 10 and DC 20 makes sense and that\u2019s for passive knowledge \u2013 we changed them to \u201cB-f\xe4rdigheter\u201d a la Drakar &amp; Demoner and then it\u2019s up to me to think \u201cis this piece of knowledge something you would definitely know (no check needed), easily know (DC 10), maybe know (DC 15), possibly know (DC 20) and definitely not know (no check needed) and then compare it to your passive knowledge score.

[Don't do it for Action Surge or similar]. This is the equiv of tapping the card in the old system.<br/><br/>Then the m\xeal\xe9e group cross-reference area, in which there is a column per monster.<br/><br/>Underneath, each monster column has their starting HP, maybe a name, and then how much damage they've taken (I suck at subtraction so with this I can count up instead of down). Monster conditions such as grappled or Vicious Mockery can go in mixed in among the HP calcs.<br/><br/>In the example, Ashinell and Ran are in the back rank,<br/>Fox, Ran and Troll have taken one action each,<br/>Troll has taken 14 damage (heroes need to keep track of their own HP on their sheets),<br/>and Fox and Troll are in a m\xeal\xe9e group together.<br/><br/>Plenty of space underneath the monster names to jot down monster HP.<br/>Am thinking that maybe three square wide monster columns are better, will try that.<br/>All of this is unplaytested. I've been thinking about this for years (I started even before I came up with the "card" system) and finally something shook loose in my head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481360/#Comment_481360" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-27T09:35:37+00:00" title="March 27, 2019  9:35AM">March 27</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21996/5e-chases/p1" rel="nofollow">Chases</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482803/#Comment_482803" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-01T06:05:57+00:00" title="May  1, 2019  6:05AM">May 1</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22051/d-d-2097e-my-new-fighting-system?new=1" rel="nofollow">[D&amp;D 2097e] My new fighting system</a></p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482948/#Comment_482948" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-05T14:07:25+00:00" title="May  5, 2019  2:07PM">May 5</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>You <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/arrow_threat/" rel="nofollow">only have to pay arrows when it\u2019s established</a> that an arrow must have been released.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\n<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22058/d-d-2097e-ammo-recovery-aiming-charging-up-spells?new=1" rel="nofollow">Obsoleted by new arrow recovery &amp; aiming rules</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
