That page also mentions a late sixties film (not sure if it's a sex film\u2026?) that I've never seen. I thought it was funny that the fourth name didn't start with a D so that's my fourth example, Ted.<br/><br/>The way I use it, these names are the <i>character's</i> names. The players also happen to be named the exact same thing as their own characters. Usually it's clear from context if it's the player ("Alice was late to the session") or the character ("Alice dropped her torch"), but when I need to disambiguate I'll try to remember to write "Bob" for the character and "Bob's player" for the player (named Bob) who plays "Bob" (the character).<br/><br/>FWIW, we use character names almost always. "Creggenmore the destroyer, would you hand me the grapes please" (grapes being my fave DMing snack since they're available year round, when cherries aren't in season, please I want cherries to come in season soon). It's only when we need to be deliberate that we use different names to differentiate "Creggenmore the destroyer feels <i>this</i>, but Neal feels <i>that</i>".<br/><br/>We also have two special hand signs. Holding hand over head: OOC statement. Pointing both hands (pointing with index&amp;long finger) to the respective sides of the head (right hand to right side of head etc): sending message through telepathy to the person I'm looking at.<br/><br/><small>uh feeling self-conscious &amp; nerdy rn</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483386/#Comment_483386" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-14T15:55:23+00:00" title="May 14, 2019  3:55PM">May 14</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2019 7:17PM by Paul_T.">edited May 14</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those hand signals are smart! <br/><br/>When I write examples, I tend to use \u201cboring\u201d real world names for players, and very obviously made-up names (\u201cCreggenmore\u201d is great!) for the characters. <br/><br/>I try to say \u201cBob\u2019s character\u201d or \u201cCreggenmore\u2019s player\u201d instead of making the reader learn two different names, whenever possible.<br/><br/>As a sort of default convention, I usually make the player male and the GM female (just to go against stereotype, but also to make it easier for the reader to follow when I use pronouns).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483389/#Comment_483389" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-14T16:59:02+00:00" title="May 14, 2019  4:59PM">May 14</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is good, I always find examples of play confusing where you have A, B, and C as players and X, Y, and Z as characters and you\u2019re expected to remember which goes with which.

It's easier to write unambiguously (as in, you have a greater chance of guessing what pronoun belongs to which character) when some characters use she/her and some use he/him.

(There are twos sets; one is based on "when in the conversation was the person first mentioned": "Alice met Bob. The former said\u2026" Where "the former" is a pronoun, "ra" is the word that means that. The other set of pronouns is a set of letter you assign to people the first time you mention them. "Alice, whom I'm gonna call A, met Bob. A then said\u2026"; that way is a bit clunky.)<br/><br/>An all-female text, at least if written by someone like me who don't write good, could end up being super clunky<br/><br/>The reason you have for writing it that way, though, Emma, is really good and ofc overrides any of the possible cons such clunkiness would have.
