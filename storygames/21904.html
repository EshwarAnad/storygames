Through the review of an often cited definition it is showed that the analytical definition of RPGs and their distinguishment from other forms of role-play are impossible in the traditional sense.<br/><br/>The second part of this paper focuses on an educational application of RPGs. Despite the noticably growing interest in the edu-larps in the last few years the current level of the relevant academic literature leaves a lot to be desired. The study methodology is generally insufficient, the texts refer to each other for support and commit a conceptual mistake \u2013 the majority of authors confuse the specific notion of larp with the general idea of role-play and use them as synonyms. As a result, a significant part of the materialized edu-larps do not possess the typical attributes of larps, but they give up exactly the essential parts of the form. The way out might be a more accurate classification of role-playing forms and a deeper understanding of their academic literature.'</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_479343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479343/#Comment_479343" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-28T07:31:06+00:00" title="December 28, 2018  7:31AM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Noticeably* maybe                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479344/#Comment_479344" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-28T10:59:48+00:00" title="December 28, 2018 10:59AM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Only one typo in the text?

By "an educational application of RPGs," are you referring to one specific application, or are you talking about educational applications in general. If the latter, I would replace "an" with "the."<br/><br/>This sentence has a comma splice: "The study methodology is generally insufficient, the texts refer to each other for support and commit a conceptual mistake \u2013 the majority of authors confuse the specific notion of larp with the general idea of role-play and use them as synonyms." I would put "and" after the comma.<br/><br/>In this sentence, it seems like "and" should be used in place of "but": As a result, a significant part of the materialized edu-larps do not possess the typical attributes of larps, but they give up exactly the essential parts of the form. <br/><br/>For me to really parse out the second paragraph, it would be helpful for me to know more about the paper.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479399/#Comment_479399" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-01T20:19:09+00:00" title="January  1, 2019  8:19PM">January 1</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 1, 2019 8:19PM by Guy Srinivasan.">edited January 1</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt; the so called role-playing game (RPG), a popular hobby group.<br/><br/>This sounds weird to me.
