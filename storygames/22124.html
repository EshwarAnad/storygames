Monsters have been coming out of the old factory and taking your friends. Your band of heroes is going in to rescue them and kill the monsters. <br/><br/>Your character is defined by a couple sentences. Jack is a down on his luck former hockey player with a big heart. Each character gets 10 points and a clock like the ones from Blades with 6 boxes. Players can use golf counters to keep track of their numbers is you are traveling. <br/><br/>You talk through the adventure freeform style. Agreeing with the characters if it makes sense and asking them to try another way if it doesn't. If they get into an interesting situation with a potential to fail the GM can ask them to pay for the success. It costs 4 points to succeed in 2 points for a success, but... outcome, or the character can fail and the player gets 3 points. <br/><br/>I situations where harm is a potential outcome damage will be incurred on a partial or complete failure. In most cases it will be one tick on your characters clock.  When the next to the last box is ticked get 5 points towards a heroic ending. When the last box is filled the character dies. The health clock can be reset one tick for every rest period. <br/><br/>I am still trying to feel out the things that this can do and think that I need to build a setting to try out.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485251/#Comment_485251" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-04T19:21:20+00:00" title="June  4, 2019  7:21PM">June 4</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2019 8:36PM by DeReel.">edited June 4</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, simple and fast.

Creating a common setting is a fine and worthy thing, but not what this is about. In contrast,  I think that it is incumbent on the GM to try and draw together elements which will intrigue the players. Then they can spend their time exploring the setting rather than agreeing on what it should be. <br/><br/>2. For the same reason I don't just let the players pay to kill all of the opposition. <br/><br/>3. Great question. If I don't care what weapons the character is using, what makes you think that anything less than 63 minutes will do?  A chunk of time when they aren't doing other things. <br/><br/>4.i am old school enough to always let the side that looses have first crack at narration. I will clear that up in future drafts.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking it seriously.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485336/#Comment_485336" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-05T17:11:37+00:00" title="June  5, 2019  5:11PM">5:11PM</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, the GM prepares a setting like with a map and all the ^^glockenspiel^^ ?<br/>You seem to assume an exploration fantasy. I have a hard time figuring how an opposition (monsters) helps with that. I'd add a luggage game (drawing your luggage) and a way to play shop (gold pieces for food and stuff like chariot parts) for basic heroic fantasy. If it's more about the freedom of imagination and some dramatic fights, I'd propose some settings with various tech levels (because freedom means you can play all these worlds), and maybe an unifying "galactic fleet" pretext narrative. By these I mean : who wants to play "win 3 points or pay 4 : the game". Get some dreams going.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
