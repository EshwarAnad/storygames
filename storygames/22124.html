Monsters have been coming out of the old factory and taking your friends. Your band of heroes is going in to rescue them and kill the monsters. <br/><br/>Your character is defined by a couple sentences. Jack is a down on his luck former hockey player with a big heart. Each character gets 10 points and a clock like the ones from Blades with 6 boxes. Players can use golf counters to keep track of their numbers is you are traveling. <br/><br/>You talk through the adventure freeform style. Agreeing with the characters if it makes sense and asking them to try another way if it doesn't. If they get into an interesting situation with a potential to fail the GM can ask them to pay for the success. It costs 4 points to succeed in 2 points for a success, but... outcome, or the character can fail and the player gets 3 points. <br/><br/>I situations where harm is a potential outcome damage will be incurred on a partial or complete failure. In most cases it will be one tick on your characters clock.  When the next to the last box is ticked get 5 points towards a heroic ending. When the last box is filled the character dies. The health clock can be reset one tick for every rest period. <br/><br/>I am still trying to feel out the things that this can do and think that I need to build a setting to try out.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
