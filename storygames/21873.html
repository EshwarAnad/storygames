They are apolemic, simple, efficient, and free. Sadly, this makes them easily overlooked and drowned into the flux of discussions. <br/>I'd like to archive them. I can easily make a drive sheet with links to the threads. There must be between 50-100 of them. That's 2 hours auto hypnosis on a grey holyday day.<br/>I am open to all categories deemed pertinent. In other words, there will be no appreciation of pertinence whatsoever. Anyway, I'll give access to the link open to modification. The only motto will be "don't delete anything."This is slacky as can be. Feel free to bring ideas to the buffet, as long as it doesn't imply actual work from people unpaid.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478333/#Comment_478333" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-30T19:18:03+00:00" title="November 30, 2018  7:18PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 30, 2018 7:19PM by WarriorMonk.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A while ago I asked people here and <a href="https://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/2013/07/31/techniques/" rel="nofollow">we made this</a>, feel free to copy and paste.<br/>I also got a couple of tools there, free to use and modify as you like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
