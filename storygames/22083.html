Others seem to be able to take it a bit further. I don\u2019t know how to feel about it.<br/><br/>Anyway, I was thinking we could talk about it here. Are you pro/con? Is it situational?

They want to take the journey which is hopefully the case for <i>every</i> railroaded game.<br/><br/>I think at this point in time we should be able to talk about the playstyle without it reflexively being defended from a downhill position. It's one of the most common playstyles (or at least it was for a while), it has its benefits and its problems. I personally do not enjoy it for tabletop games as a player or as a DM/GM/Keeper/MC/SM.
