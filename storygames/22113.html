Some 90s games.</p><p><strong>I had never seen a module</strong>, a location-based module. <em>I had no idea that such a thing could exist</em>.</p><p>I had seen railroad- or funnel- type <strong>adventure books</strong>. These absolutely sucked because the players zagged off them within three seconds.</p><p>Sometimes books mentioned prepping a game world and I was like \u201cPrepping every grain of sand on the entire planet, that\u2019s not reasonable, no, no, no!\u201d (Similar to how some people reacted in my other thread recently). Because I hadn\u2019t seen the tools that the OSR community cooked up (some of these weren\u2019t new).</p><p>I was like \u201cWait, do they <em>really</em> mean that you can just cheat and railroad and force and do all kinds of shit back here behind this screen? Why don\u2019t you just improvise everything then? Why do you need all of these heavy rules and all these heavy traditional techniques?\u201d (Also in the 90s, <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/dod91-stridsdiagram.jpg" rel="nofollow">games were super complicated &amp; cumbersome</a>. Everything was like \u201coh this is a Mental Hard Skill it costs 12 character points to buy to the level of your attribute +2\u201d and I was like uh\u2026 I\u2019m just a li\u2019l kid and also math is hard.) First three or four years wasted on just being confused!!! Everyone was like \u201cSandra, don\u2019t even <em>look</em> at D&amp;D, it sucks, what is AC anyway, you dodge better in plate are you serious? What\u2019s a class and level, you graduate fighter school in the middle of the dungeon?\u201d)</p><p>And then I found Everway and Fudge/SLUG to be like \u201chey girl relax you can play these kindsa game more easily\u201d. Some ten years of pretty happy &amp; working gaming! Dropping the dice&amp;cards after a while. Some really memorable sessions that I\u2019ll treasure always. But\u2026 I had one player who was really into this type of gaming but everyone else dropped out and was Not Into It. I had a really hard time keeping players around and I didn\u2019t know why and maybe they didn\u2019t know either but\u2026</p><p><small>I believe now why they didn\u2019t like it is that the agency was super low. I made pregens, I \u201cimprovised\u201d the stories, the outcomes of their actions\u2026 the one player that it grooved with was skilled at switching stances on a moment\u2019s notice. For example, he made a character that could switch minds and memories with other characters, so when he stole the memories of the NPC, I could be like \u201cAnd now, it\u2019s time for you to reveal your big secret plan!\u201d and he, <em>as the NPC</em>, would reveal a perfectly grand secret plan that that NPC could\u2019ve created. Stance hopping. I trusted him with this and when I didn\u2019t extend that same trust to other players, they dropped out. When I <em>did</em> extend the same trust to other players, they froze in the headlights &amp; dropped out.</small></p><p>Then , at a party, someone told me about an anecdote from a game. Something about a stolen helicopter and a one in two hundred chance that the PCs could fly it correctly with no skill and them flying it for a while\u2014longer than anyone expected\u2014until crashing it and dying. I was like \u201cWait, that could <em>never</em> happen in my happy rule-less/dice-less game. <em>[They would\u2019ve just said \u201cnuh-uh, we don\u2019t die\u201d and/or I would\u2019ve been too invested in their success to put them in real harms way]</em> I need to bring back rules!\u201d</p><p>Then followed seven years or so (roughly) of absolutely miserable and awful gaming! Flailing around needing blorb but not having any idea about blorb or that anything like blorb could exist! Remember, <em>I had never seen a location-based module</em>. I read like 200 core books, the occasional railroady adventure book or campaign book, being like\u2026 \u201cbut these games are <em>half</em> games, there are rules for the PCs but where are the <em>rules</em> for the GM/Storyteller/Keeper?\u201d</p><p>There are posts on S-G from me from that period where I\u2019m applying this to Lady Blackbird and Cthulhu Dark (the latter though <em>isn\u2019t</em> \u201chalf a game\u201d because it does have the \u201cUse these rules to play modules\u201d clause. It\u2019s just that I hadn\u2019t seen any of these modules\u2014the CoC / ToC adventures that I <em>had</em> stumbled over where railroady).</p><p>There\u2019s a thread on The Big Purple where I\u2019m arguing with a GURPS fan and I\u2019m being so stupid (from the POV of someone who knows that <em>prep</em> and <em>blorb</em> are things). I\u2019m discussing the jumping rules which are\u2026 kinda complicated\u2026 you can jump <code>(lowest of [(2 \xd7 [BM + yards ran before jump]) - 3 feet], (2 \xd7 [(2 \xd7 [BM]) - 3 feet]))</code>, where \u201cBM\u201d is <code>floor([(HT+DX)/4] + [increments of five character points spent during creation])</code>. (You can see why I kinda bounced off it as a kid. And why it lead me to having to learn a bunch of math and stuff later in life. Which is boring af.) And I\u2019m like OK, cool, cool, where are the rules for how wide chasms the GM can put in there? I couldn\u2019t find them? And the guy, the GURPS fan is like \u201cthe GM can just decide freely the chasm widths\u201d and I\u2019m like <em>whiskey tango actual foxtrot</em>? Because I didn\u2019t understand how <em>prep</em> could work. <em>I had never seen a location based module.</em> I was all character points and \u201cfairness\u201d and\u2026 and\u2026</p><p>Here is why \u201cNo Paper After Seeing Rock\u201d principle starts to make sense, too, right? Placing chasms after character creation does feel a bit\u2026</p><p>At this point I\u2019m also doing Fiasco (which works great\u2014like the good games with the stance-switching-skilled guy except more people are being able to grok it because the game explains itself way better than I ever did, <strong>and</strong>, more importantly, we\u2019re less tied to <em>my</em> conception of how the story should unfold) and Fate (which works not so great because I have no diegetic coherence and also the game is imbalanced af, sometimes they breeze through an army of death robots and sometimes they lose horribly to a tiny li\u2019l werewolf) and then bam. First few months of 2013, I think it was. [So way late to the party compared to Grognardia and the OSR community which, at that point, had grown a large presence even in my own city.] \u201cMirror story\u201d happens. I\u2019m like whaaaat. <strong>This is what I\u2019ve been looking for all my life!</strong></p><p>It\u2019s even possible that I had <em>played</em> in some fully blorby games [with rando passing-through GMs] before that, I remember a WoD game that was awesome or a CoC game that was unusally tense. But I didn\u2019t know they were blorby. I was like \u201cWhat <em>are</em> those rules the DM is using to create this stuff? All of this could just as easily be improvised, right? Is it?\u201d Playing in The Lost City not knowing that it was blorby or what blorb was \u201cbut an unsually cool session\u201d, reading the module [seeing how much "there" there was], and then shortly thereafter playing in the \u201cmirror story\u201d game\u2026 just <em>finally</em> getting it.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484971/#Comment_484971" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-02T08:06:38+00:00" title="June  2, 2019  8:06AM">June 2</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>That was also my reaction when I read the \u201cno myth\u201d thread on Forge\u2026 \u201cYou mean like I\u2019ve been playing for the last ten years already?\u201d</p><p>I want to teach and explain blorb &amp; gloracle, especially to new DMs, because I know for a <i>fact</i> that some people do not know that it exists, because I was one.</p><p>Now, a lot of GMs saw success in the seventies and eighties by <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20672/d-d-expert-set-dice-shenanigans/p1" rel="nofollow">compromising blorb</a> a little bit, here and there.
