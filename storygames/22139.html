Full of rando tables as per usual. The more big it is the better for purps of diluting the custom stuff so that not break the \u201cno paper after seeing rock\u201d principle <em>too</em> much. For the purps of this, I want there to be a chance that something is never ever rolled.</li><li>A list of traits, ideals, bonds, flaws and trinkets.</li></ol><table><colgroup><col width="2%"/><col width="2%"/><col width="2%"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Mandatory for players to add</th><th>Mandatory for DM to use</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Personality Trait</td><td>0, it\u2019s just good to have some</td><td>0, but if you find an actionable one go for it</td></tr><tr><td>Ideal</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Bonds</td><td>3 (two to other players and one normal one)</td><td>1 <strong>if</strong> they provided an normal one, you gotta use it</td></tr><tr><td>Flaws</td><td>0, it\u2019s just good to have one</td><td>0, but if you find an actionable one go for it</td></tr><tr><td>Trinket</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Background specific stuff such as hermit discovery</td><td>0, this is optional</td><td>\u221e, DMs, if this is there, this needs to be used</td></tr><tr><td>XGE class specific stuff</td><td>0, this is optional</td><td>\u221e, DMs, if this is there, this needs to be used</td></tr><tr><td>XGE life path stuff, friends &amp; family rolled up</td><td>0, this is optional</td><td>\u221e, DMs, if this is there, this needs to be used</td></tr></tbody></table>Trinkets fell away because they never got reincorporated into our play since it\u2019s so blorby.<br/><br/>But here they\u2019re gonna get used again.<br/><br/>Players, you need to hand in an ideal, a trinket, and three bonds. XP is frozen until you comply. Traits &amp; flaws are good for you. One of the bond is your normal background bond, the other two bonds are Hillfolk \u201cunattainable wants\u201d to other PCs.<br/><br/>DM, you\u2019re gonna make a big old list. The \u201cmaster challenge list\u201d.<br/><br/>To that list you add all the ideals, bonds, trinkets, background-specific stuff, XGE-stuff, and if you find any exceptionally actionable flaws &amp; traits [you\u2019ll gonna know what that means later in this process] add them in too. Make some sorta note which character they came from.\n<h2 id="when-prepping">When prepping</h2>For each item on the \u201cmaster challenge list\u201d you make sure that there is at least one relevant thing on your other tables that are in use. Could be encounter tables, rando NPC quality tables, treasure drop tables etc. If there isn\u2019t, you add one.<br/><br/>An optional, but good prompt for you <em>when you have your prepping hat on</em> is \u201chow can I make this go away?\u201d A promise goes away by fulfilling it or breaking it, a key goes away by finding the lock for it or having it stolen, an ideal goes away by being given up on etc. <small>Careful now; a lot of posts on /r/rpghorrorstories are about \u201cThe DM took away the thing about my character that was cool\u201d. So IDK.</small><br/><br/>So a promise to rescue your father can lead to the actual father being locked up somewhere. Idk.<br/><br/>The items in the \u201cmaster challenge list\u201d cause other things to be added to your normal rando tables. Again, stick to tables that <em>are</em> in active use in the particular campaign type that you\u2019re running. (Maybe you can add a new category of table and start using it more, such as an \u201cNPC relevancy\u201d table to add onto any other NPC they meet, buuut\u2026 an entry such as \u201cThis is Alice\u2019s father\u201d might end up feeling super post-hoc and un-blorby and retconny and fake. <b>TODO</b> solve this problem before implementing the rule.)<br/><br/>When a PC dies, remove their stuff from the \u201cmaster challenge list\u201d <em>but not</em> the stuff that was added to the normal rando table. So Alice\u2019s father is still running around out there.<br/><br/>Always keep the master challenge list current and when prepping always make sure that each entry on the master challenge list has at least one representative on the normal rando tables.\n<h2 id="when-running">When running</h2>You need to absolutely forget why you put the thing on the list. No longer is it\u2019s purpose to \u201cremove the trait\u201d or whatever. It\u2019s just a normal encounter with Alice\u2019s father or a treasure chest that matches Bob\u2019s trinket key or whatever. <strong>TODO</strong> this type of compartmentalization between prepping&amp;running hats is difficult, not sure how to fix\u2026?<br/><br/>What\u2019s cool though is that you <em>don\u2019t</em> need to refer to the master challenge list constantly fretting \u201cis there something relevant?\u201d The items on your lists are doing the work for you, just run the game normally &amp; blorbily. Let the meetings with these entities play out naturally.\n<h2 id="idk-this-can-sometimes-come-across-as-really-fake">IDK this can sometimes come across as really fake</h2>We had this problem in our CoS campaign where there actually <em>was</em> an old ship\u2019s flag on the rando treasure drop table and our players though this was fakily inserted to match one of the PC\u2019s sailor background. Which, uh, would\u2019ve been kind of a toothless insert not really pulling the weight of undermining the feeling of tangibility that much.<br/><br/>So some kinda transparency of method about this is prob a good idea. IDK. Gonna think some more about this before I try to implement it.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486018/#Comment_486018" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-14T06:04:15+00:00" title="June 14, 2019  6:04AM">June 14</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            # Unique things<br/><br/>Place them.
