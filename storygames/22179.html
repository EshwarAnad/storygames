                    Sadly, likely the last thread of this kind <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/><br/><br/>I present to you the new <b><a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/08/05/crowdfunding-collection-114/" rel="nofollow">Crowdfunding Collection no. 114, including every tabletop rpg project started between 07/14 and 08/04.</a></b><br/><br/>While this collection is done on its supposed weekly schedule, the next one might get delayed a week or two, because of convention season. With that being said, let’s get started.<br/>While the nuclear post-apocalyptic setting of <b>HOPE RPG</b> isn’t new, I am intruiged by the base building aspect and exploration system. Who along with being affordable did convince me to back the project. I did took a bit longer deciding to back <b>Resist &amp; Remember: Weimar</b>. The topic and time period (1930 till ~1935) is more weighty and it needs to be done well, in a sensible fashion and in good taste. The presentation did in the end convince me and I strongly recommend having a look. The second edition of <b>Fiasco: The Cinematic Game of Plans Gone Wrong</b> on the other hand is quite an easy recommendation. The story game by Bullpit Games charmed me in it’s first edition and I am convinced the second edition will be just as good if not better. Plus, the box set is really nice. Thus, give it a chance. If you are maybe more into Fate or transform your gaming experience with changing robots, take a look at <b>COMMANDROIDS: A WORLD TRANSFORMED</b>.<br/>You’ll find a quite some fantasy role-playing games as well. For example the <b>Great Sword Tabletop RPG</b>, which looks great and promises a quite tactical, yet still streamlined, system with a more traditional looking setting. <b>Pathos: War of Gods</b> does look cool as well, yet focuses on the question whether to serve the gods or see them toppled like the chars are Kratos. With leaning towards the toppled side of things. If you like the Redwall novels or playing furry adventures, you should check out <b>Paws &amp; Claws</b>, which offers you a quickstarter to make your mind up. <b>Otherworlds</b> does offer a view into their rules and character creation as well, while offering more of a seemingly Anime inspired setting.<br/>I sorted <b>Rage-o-Meter</b> among the hybrid games, as it does quite look like a mixture of card- or boardgame with rpg-elements. On the other hand <b>Words without Harmony</b> mostly ended up there, because it seems more firmly rooted in storytelling games. I think both deserve consideration.<br/>There are other cool projects, like the Patreon for <b>POCGamer</b> who is creating supplementary stuff, the <b>Naughty Dice Jail</b> for your misrolling dice, projects like <b>Dragon’s Breath</b> and <b>‚Spirit Of‘ Atlantis</b> where you can get potential inmates or stuff like the <b>Role Playing Games Television</b> or rather webseries.<br/>Next to many cool projects, that you can check out here:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>4 Role-Playing Games<br/>4 Fantasy Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Hybrid Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Patreon<br/>2 Sourcebooks<br/>1 Adventure<br/>6 D&amp;D 5E Adventures<br/>5 Dice Projects<br/>5 Accessoires<br/>2 Enamel Pins<br/>1 Playingcards<br/>1 Webserie<br/>3 Various RPG Projects<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/><b>Italian Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/><b>Swedish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Role-Playing Games<br/><br/>Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/08/05/crowdfunding-collection-114/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2019/08/05/crowdfunding-collection-114/</a><br/> </div>

                            That's it!<br/><br/>The forum is here:<br/><br/><a href="https://fictioneers.net/forum" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://fictioneers.net/forum</a><br/><br/>And lots of Story Games are already there, chatting and talking.<br/><br/>The Gauntlet might also welcome your efforts. There are lots of people there specifically interested in the particular games you're cataloguing, which is a great fit (and likely many of the creators!). However, they also have pretty strict moderation, so I can imagine them asking you to post in some particular or specific way, perhaps, which could be a minus.                        </div>
