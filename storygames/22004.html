Smaller stuff is preferred since I\u2019ll be aiming for a 32 page, B&amp;W, digest sized zine I think and quick turn around would keep everyone involved from burn out.<br/><br/>I\u2019m looking for an army of translators active in game scenes that can pitch me games they\u2019d like to see translated so I can pay them to do that. I don\u2019t mind helping with editing and localizing so you\u2019d by no means have to be a professional translator. <br/><br/>I\u2019d pay translators minimum 8 cents a word, maybe a negotiated flat fee for a game poem or more cents for something super grueling and/or technical.<br/><br/>The original authors would get a royalty cut from copies sold in perpetuity. I\u2019m thinking 2% per page taken up by their work in the zine, with a min of 2%.<br/><br/>If you or anyone you know is interested in being a translator who can approach game authors to get their works translated for me I\u2019d love to hear from you! My email is samjokopublishing@gmail.com, twitter handle is kylejsimons.<br/><br/>I\u2019ve also been trying to think of a cool name for the zine so any ideas here would be helpful as well! I think a one-word name would be best.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482375/#Comment_482375" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-23T02:52:26+00:00" title="April 23, 2019  2:52AM">April 23</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just wanted to bump this to say that I launched the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/samjoko" rel="nofollow">Patreon</a> for this earlier today.
